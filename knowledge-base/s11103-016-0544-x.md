Abstract  Short-chain peptides play important roles in plant development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Here, we characterized a gene of unknown function termed OsDT11, which encodes an 88 amino acid short-chain peptide and belongs to the cysteine-rich peptide family. It was found that the expression of OsDT11 can be activated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. Compared with wild-type lines, the OsDT11-overexpression lines displayed dramatically enhanced tolerance to drought and had reduced water loss, reduced stomatal density, and an increased the concentration of abscisic acid (ABA). The suppression of OsDT11 expression resulted in an increased sensitivity to drought compared to wild-type expression. Several drought-related genes, including genes encoding abscisic acid (ABA) signaling markers, were also strongly induced in the OsDT11-overexpressing lines. Moreover, the expression of OsDT11 was repressed in ABA-insensitive mutant Osbzip23 and Os2H16 RNAi lines. These results suggest that OsDT11-mediated drought tolerance may be dependent on the ABA signaling pathway.

# Introduction

Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important cereal crop that is used as a staple food by more than half of the world’s population (Swamy et al. 2013). However, it is sensitive to drought stress, which negatively affects plant growth and crop productivity worldwide (Liu et al. 2012).

Drought stress is known to induce a range of physiological and biochemical responses in plants, including stomatal closure, repression of cell growth and photosynthesis, and activation of respiration (Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki 2007). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of drought response is critical for the improvement of drought tolerance using molecular techniques. In plants, abscisic acid (ABA) plays important roles in drought response and tolerance, and it accumulates under osmotic stress and other water-deficient conditions (Nakashima et al. 2009). The ABA-responsive element (ABRE, PyACGTGG/TC), which specifically binds to bZIP transcription factors (TFs), is the major cis-element regulating the expression of ABA-responsive genes (Maruyama et al. 2012). It has been proposed that more than one ABRE or a combination of an ABRE and a coupling element (CE) in the promoter region, is required for regulating ABA-responsive gene expression (Nakashima and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki 2013). The ABA-dependent signaling pathway is controlled by sucrose nonfermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2), group A 2C-type protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), and RCAR/PYR/PYL ABA receptors in land plants (Miyakawa et al. 2013). In addition, ABA-independent signaling pathways, which include dehydration-responsive element (DRE)-binding (DREB) protein TFs (Liu et al. 2013) and NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) TFs, are also involved in drought stress responses (Nakashima et al. 2012). Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that interactions occur between the ABA-dependent signaling pathway and other signaling factors during stress responses. For instance, the expression of DREB2A is regulated by interactions between AREB/ABF TFs and SnRK2s under osmatic stress conditions (Kim et al. 2011), demonstrating the existence of complex interactions between AREB and DREB elements at the transcriptional level. Moreover, it has been reported that ANAC096 of Arabidopsis functions in coordination with AREB/ABF factors under dehydration and osmotic stress conditions (Xu et al. 2013), suggesting the existence of interactions between AREB/ABF and NAC factors. Finally, ethylene response factor 1 (ERF1), which is an upstream TF in both ethylene and jasmonate signaling, has been found to regulate gene expression by binding to the DRE/CRT during abiotic stress in Arabidopsis (Cheng et al. 2013). The results imply that ethylene, jasmonate, and the ABA signaling pathway may participate in crosstalk.

Cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs), the most prominent small signaling peptides in some plant species (Silverstein et al. 2007), are divergent among different groups. They all share the following three features: (I) a size of typically <160 amino acids, (II) a conserved N-terminus that functions as a signal peptide, and (III) a cysteine-rich C-terminus that usually contains 4–16 cysteine residues (Marshall et al. 2011). It has been reported that CRPs control multiple processes in plants ranging from pathogen resistance and plant-bacteria symbiosis to plant development. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are highly basic in nature and possess a cysteine-rich sequence, are key signaling factors for plant resistance to pathogens (Astafieva et al. 2013). For instance, CaAMP1, an AMP isolated from pepper (Capsicum annuum), has been shown to improve resistance to hemibiotrophic bacterial and fungal necrotrophic pathogens in Arabidopsis (Lee et al. 2008). Moreover, PmAMP1 isolated from Pinus monticola has been demonstrated to induce resistance to multiple fungal pathogens in Brassica napus (Verma et al. 2012). CRPs play important roles in plant-bacteria symbiosis. Leguminous plant species establish symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia, which initiate nodule organogenesis and provide combined nitrogen to support plant growth (Meilhoc et al. 2011). Nearly 600 nodule-specific CRPs, termed nodule cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs), have been characterized in nodulated legumes by bioinformatics methods and are present in the Medicago gene expression database (Zhou et al. 2013). Among these NCRs, NCR247 has been reported to contribute to bacteroid differentiation through multiple mechanisms (Farkas et al. 2014), while NCR247 and NCR335 are able to induce membrane depolarization-associated changes in Sinorhizobium meliloti (Tiricz et al. 2013). Furthermore, increasing evidence has demonstrated that CRPs act as important signaling peptides that mediate plant development and production processes such as root development (Srivastava et al. 2009), pollen, anther (Ge et al. 2010), and seed development (Wuest 2010).

Little is currently known about the function of CRPs in drought tolerance. In this study, a small peptide termed drought tolerance 11 (OsDT11), which is encoded by the LOC_Os11g10590 gene, was characterized as a CRP and was found to be involved in ABA-dependent drought tolerance in rice. The findings of this study could provide more comprehensive insights into the expansive functions of CRPs and the molecular mechanisms of drought stress.

# Materials and methods

# Plant materials and growth conditions

Rice cultivar (O. sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Zhonghua11, ZH11), Osbzip23 (an ABA-insensitive mutant in a ZH11 background),  Os2H16-overexpressing,  and  RNAi  lines were used in this study (Xiang et al. 2008; Li et al. 2013a). Plants were grown in a greenhouse at 28 ^∘C and 80 % relative humidity with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle. For the realtime PCR analysis of OsDT11 in different tissues, the young leaf, young root, young culm, leaf, root, culm, anther, pistil, and endosperm were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. Seedlings of 7-day-old plants were used for the drought and salt treatments. The roots of the plants were immersed in polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000 (15 % w/v) to mimic drought stress and in 100 mM NaCl to induce salt stress. The treated roots were then harvested at 0, 3, 6 or 24 h for RNA isolation. To detect the expression of OsDT11 and the drought-associated and ABA-responsive genes, the roots of 7-day-old transgenic and wild-type seedlings were treated with PEG-8000 or 100 mM NaCl for 24 h (Campo et al. 2012). The roots were then collected and used for total RNA extraction.

# Construction of OsDT11 expression vector and generation of transgenic rice

To construct a transformation vector, the full-length OsDT11 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Next, the PCR-amplified OsDT11 fragment was digested by Kpn I and Bam HI and ligated into Kpn I-/Bam HI-digested pU1301 (Qiu et al. 2007) to construct an overexpression vector. For the construction of a knockdown vector, amplified OsDT11 cDNA with Spe I and Kpn I restriction sites added to the 5^' end and Sac I and Bam HI restriction sites added to the 3^' end was double-digested with Kpn I, Bam HI, Spe I and Sac I. The digested fragment was cloned first into Kpn I-/Bam HI-digested ds1301 (Li et al. 2013a) and then into Spe I-/Sac I-digested ds1301 to construct a knockdown vector (Supplementary Fig. S1).

For the generation of transgenic rice, the expression vector was introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 strain and then used to infect the embryonic callus derived from mature embryos of the ZH11 line (Hiei et al. 1994). PCR was used to select positive lines, and 13 and 26 T_0 lines showing OsDT11 overexpression and suppression, respectively, were ultimately obtained. Three T_0 lines each from the overexpressing and suppressing plants were selected to generate T_1 lines for further analysis.

# Subcellular localization of the OsDT11 protein in tobacco epidermal cells

The full-length ORF sequence of OsDT11 was amplified by PCR with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. After the sequence of the fragment was verified, it was fused into the modified pCAMBIA1301 vector pU1300 (Qiu et al. 2007) to produce the fusion vector (p35S::OsDT11- RFP). The Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 strain was then transformed with p35S::OsDT11-RFP and control (p35S::RFP) vector and cultured until the OD ratio reached 1.0. A GV3101 suspension was subsequently infiltrated into the epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana (NB) and incubated for 48 h at 28 ^∘𝐂 for the observation of RFP by fluorescence confocal microscopy (TCS SP5, Leica, Germany). Plasmolysis was carried out by infiltrating leaves with a 700 mM sucrose solution and then soaking the leaves in a sucrose solution for ^6 h , before microscopic examination.

# RNA extraction and gene expression analysis by realtime PCR

Total RNA was extracted from 100  mg of tissue using TRIzol reagent (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out for each RNA sample using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit and gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Dalian, CN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad iQ^rw5 Light Cycler system with SYBR^(ℝ) Premix Ex Taq  (Tli RNase H Plus; Takara, Dalian, CN). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 ^∘C for 30 s , followed by 40 cycles of 95 ^∘C for 5 s, 55 ^∘C for 20 s. , and 72 ^∘C for 30 s .OsActin1 (AY212324) was used as an internal control, and two biological replicates and three technical replicates were used for each experiment. The relative expression levels were calculated using the ∆∆Ct method (Li et al. 2013b).

# Drought stress treatment

Three independent T_1 lines and at least 10 plants per line were validated as positive plants by PCR at seedling. They were selected for the drought treatment and were compared to 12 wild-type rice plants. Fifteen-day-old seedlings were treated by withholding water for 17 days. When the drought phenotype was observed in different seedlings, they were irrigated for 7 days to restore normal conditions. The weights of the transgenic and wild-type plants were measured before and after the drought treatment to calculate the water loss for the evaluation of drought tolerance. The water loss was calculated using the following formula (Chen et al. 2014):

Water  loss (%) = (fresh  weight − dry  weight)/fresh weight ×100 .

# Environmental scanning electronic microscopy (ESEM) assay

Fifteen-day-old rice plants were treated under drought stress conditions for 7 days, and the middle sections of the second true leaves were then randomly taken from the treatment and control groups. The leaves were then cut into 3-5 mm segments, and the stomata and wax distribution on the fresh leaf surface were quickly visualized by ESEM (Quanta 250, Fei CO., USA) in the sample room of 7.33×10^2 Pa at 5 ^∘C Three leaves of each genotype were observed for replicates.

# Determination of ABA concentration

The ABA concentration was determined using LC-MS/MS as previously described with some modifications (LópezRáez et al. 2010). First, approximately 200 mg of leaf tissue was collected from 15-day-old wild-type and OsDT11- overexpressing rice seedlings and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The ABA hormone was extracted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate spiked with an internal standard 20 ng of [^2H_6] -ABA). After vortexing for 10 min , the organic phase was obtained by centrifugation at 16,100×g for 15 min at 4 ^∘C . The samples were then evaporated almost to dryness in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 30 ^∘𝐂 . Next, the leaf materials were diluted with 600 L of methanol:water (70:30, v/v). A Shimadzu LCMS 8040 system (Shimadzu, Japan) was used for ABA quantification. Chromatography was performed using a Shimadzu FPLC system, and separation was achieved with a Shimadzu pack XR-ODS column (2.0 mm ID×75 mm) ). Formic acid (0.05 %) and ammonium formate 5 mM) in water and methanol, respectively, served as mobile phases A and B, respectively. The elution protocol was as follows: 0-0.01 min ,20 % B; 0.01–8.0 min ,20-95 % B; and 8.0-8.1 min ,20 % B. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.3 mLmin^-1 , and the column temperature was set at 50 ^∘C . An ESI tandem mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was operated in the negative ionization mode, and the instrument parameters were optimized by infusion experiments with pure standards. The ion spray voltage was controlled at -3500 eV, and the heating block temperature was maintained at 500 ^∘C , while the desolvation line temperature was maintained at 300 ^∘C . The nebulizing gas flow rate, drying gas flow rate, and collision gas pressure were set at Fig. 1  Analysis of the amino acid sequence of OsDT11. a A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA6.06 with the neighbor-joining method.

3, 15 L min^-1 , and 230 KPa , respectively. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to monitor the analyte parent ion to product ion:mass-to-charge ratio [m/z] 263.0 to 153.2 (collision energy, -17 V ; Q1 pre-bias, -10 V ; and Q3 prebias, -27 V) for ABA. Both the Q1 and Q3 quadrupoles were retained at unit resolution. Data acquisition and processing were performed using Lab Solutions Main software (Shimadzu). The linearity analysis of ionization efficiencies was performed using a dilution series of standard mixtures. Sample-derived ABA concentrations were determined by calculating the ratio of the ion intensity to the intensity of the respective internal standard. All of the quantifications were corrected based on sample dilution, and the extractions were performed with five biological replicates. Finally, the resulting ABA concentrations in the different samples were determined per gram of fresh mass, and statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test.

# Statistical analysis

All of the experiments were repeated at least three times, and the resulting data were subjected to an analysis of standard deviations, which was visualized using error bars. A one-way analysis of variance was conducted, and significant differences were calculated using the paired t test. A P value of <0.05 was regarded as significant, and a P value of _<0.01 was considered highly significant. The correlation analysis was carried out using SPSS software (Ebrahimpour et al. 2013).

# Results

# OsDT11 belongs to the CRP famil

OsDT11 (LOC_Os11g10590), which has a 714 bp-long fulllength cDNA sequence and encodes a putative protein of 88 amino acids, is a typical-sized short-chain peptide. A phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence indicated that the OsDT11 protein has an unknown function (Fig. 1a). A conserved motif analysis of OsDT11 was also carried out using the MEME online program (http://meme-suite.org/ tools/meme). Alignments with other high-similarity CRP sequences from wild rice species and plants showed that this protein was highly conserved among the proteins (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the OsDT11 peptide contains eight cysteines at the C-terminus, indicating that it is a member of the CRP family. A signal peptide analysis performed using SignalP 3.0 software (Bendtsen et al. 2004) revealed that amino acids 1–26 contain a signal peptide (Fig. 2a). Overall, the analysis of the OsDT11 sequence demonstrated that this protein belongs to the CRP family.

# OsDT11 is predicted to be a secreted signal peptide

Since OsDT11 is predicted to be a secreted protein, the subcellular localization of OsDT11 was determined by fusing the OsDT11 ORF to RFP in a p35S::RFP vector by in vivo protein targeting in NB epidermal cells by performing an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient assay. After incubation for 48 h , the RFP signals were mainly detected in the cell-wall of OsDT11-RFP transformed cells, while the control cells (transformed with the RFP construct) displayed ubiquitous RFP signals, demonstrating that OsDT11 is a secreted signal peptide (Fig. 2b–d). Moreover, when the infiltrated leaf sections were plasmolyzed, the OsDT11-RFP fusion proteins were located on the cell wall (Fig. S2).

# Expression pattern of OsDT11

To elucidate the expression pattern of the OsDT11 gene, we analyzed its expression profile in different rice tissues by realtime PCR. OsDT11 was found to be constitutively expressed in almost all of the tissues and organs examined, including the leaf, root, culm, pistil, anther and endosperm tissues. Obviously, OsDT11 expression in the leaf and root tissues was lower than that in the other tissues (Fig. 3a). We also investigated the expression pattern of OsDT11 under osmotic and salt stress conditions. As shown in Fig. 3b, its expression was highly induced by PEG 8000 treatment after ^6h after which it gradually returned to a normal level at 24 h Moreover, its expression level was higher at ^3 h than at 6 and 24 h in response to treatment with 100 mM (Fig. 3c), suggesting that OsDT11 was also up-regulated by salt stress.

# Overexpression of OsDT11 improves tolerance to drought stress

Because OsDT11 expression was strongly induced by osmotic stress, the drought tolerance of transgenic rice was assessed. Thirteen OsDT11-overexpressing lines were obtained, and three of them (pU1301::OsDT11-1,3, and 4) were selected for determination of the transcript level. When the plants were 15 days old, both the overexpressing and wild-type lines were deprived of water for 17 days. After the treatment, most of the wild-type plants withered, while the overexpressing lines exhibited less wilting compared with the control plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). Water was then supplied for 7 days, resulting in the recovery of all of the transgenic lines but not the wild-type plants (Fig. 4a, panel RW). OsDT11 expression in the transgenic plants was significantly correlated with water loss (𝐫=-0.855 , Fig. 4b, c).

The bars represent the mean ± SD

To further confirm the function of OsDT11 in drought tolerance, the knockdown transgenic lines were also examined under drought stress conditions. The transgenic plants were found to be more sensitive to drought stress than the wildtype plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). After rewatering for 7 days, neither the transgenic nor the wild-type lines recovered (Fig. 4a, panel RW). The water loss of the wild-type plants was approximately 10 % lower than that of the suppressed plants. Additionally, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the OsDT11 expression level in the knockdown lines was associated with water loss (r=-0.767 ,Fig. 4b, c). These results indicate that the overexpression of OsDT11 improves the tolerance to drought stress in rice.

To further evaluate the physiological mechanism by which OsDT11 enables the plant to retain water, the stomata and wax on the leaf surface of wild-type and transgenic plants were visualized by ESEM. It was found that the stomatal size was smaller on the leaf surface of wildtype plants under drought stress conditions, compared with the wild-type plants under normal condition (Fig. 5a, b). However, there was no obvious difference between the overexpressing lines and wild-type plants under normal conditions, and the overexpression lines after drought treatment (Fig.  5c, d). Similar results were observed for the calculated stomatal density. Only the drought-stressed wild-type plants presented as higher stomatal density on the leaves than the others three samples (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, there was no obvious difference between the wax distribution of the wild-type and transgenic lines under normal conditions, and a reduction in wax content was only observed for wild-type lines after drought treatment (Fig. S3). These results indicate that OsDT11 overexpression may improve water retention by modulating stomatal density.

Priming the expression of drought-associated marker genes by overexpressing OsDT11

To elucidate the role of OsDT11 in the regulation of drought stress tolerance, the expression levels of three drought-associated  marker  genes,  Dip1,  Rab21,  and OSE2, were analyzed in the transgenic lines and compared to those in the wild-type lines. As shown in Fig. 6, all three genes were highly induced by drought stress in the overexpressing plants, while they displayed no relevant differences in expression between the wild-type and transgenic lines under normal conditions. These results demonstrate that the overexpression of O s D T I I enhances  the  drought-associated  expression  of  these genes in accordance with the drought tolerance phenotype in transgenic plants.

# OsDT11 may be involved in the ABA signaling pathway

It has been reported that the hormone ABA plays important roles in the response to drought stress in plants. To evaluate whether OsDT11 participates in the ABA signaling pathway, the expression levels of BURP, GRAM, and HVA22, which are induced by ABA, were detected in overexpressing and wild-type lines under normal watering and drought stress conditions. As shown in Fig.  7, the expression of these three genes was slightly higher in the transgenic plants than in the wild-type plants under regular watering conditions. However, under the drought stress conditions, the genes exhibited significantly increased expression in the overexpressing lines compared with the wild-type plants (Fig.  7a–c). Additionally, OsDT11 expression was found to be down-regulated in the Osbzip23 mutant, which is insensitive to ABA (Fig. 7d). OsDT11 expression was also measured in the Os2H16-overexpressing and suppressed lines because this gene is involved in the biotic and abiotic stress responses, possibly via the ABA signaling pathway in rice. The OsDT11 expression level was highly induced in the overexpressing lines, while it was slightly decreased in the suppressed plants compared with the wild-type plants (Fig. 7e). These results show that OsDT11 overexpression could improve the activation of ABA-inducible genes and that OsDT11 may function in association with OsbZIP23 and O s2H I6 in the ABA signaling pathway.

# ABA concentration is increased in OsDT11- overexpressing lines

To test whether ABA biosynthesis was affected in the transgenic plants, the endogenous ABA levels in the overexpressing and wild-type lines were measured under normal conditions and were found to be 16.25 ng g^-1F W on average in the wild-type seedlings, while they were increased to 61.56, 35.91, and 24.96 ng^-1F W in the three different pU1301::OsDT11 lines, respectively (Fig.  8). These findings suggested that the ABA concentration was highly increased in the overexpressing seedlings, demonstrating that ABA biosynthesis was affected in the OsDT11 transgenic plants.

# Promoter cis-element analysis of OsDT11

To understand why the overexpression of OsDT11 enhances drought tolerance and increases the ABA concentration, the 1500-base pair (bp) upstream promoter sequence of OsDT11was analyzed using PlantCARE (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/)  (Rombauts et al. 1999). As listed in Table  1, multiple cis-elements related to ABA and stress responsiveness were identified, including the ABA-responsive element (ABRE), the MYB binding site (MBS) involved in drought inducibility, defense and stress-responsive elements (TC-rich repeats) and regulatory elements involved in cold and dehydration responsiveness (C-repeat/DRE). In addition, some other regulatory elements such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA)- responsive elements (CGTCA motif), gibberellin-responsive  elements  (GARE  motif,  P-box),  light-responsive elements (ACE, G-box) and common cis-acting elements in  promoter  and  enhancer  regions  (CAAT-box)  were identified.

# Discussion

Since the first plant small signaling peptide, named tomato systemin (TomSys), was identified in a wounded tomato leaf (Green and Ryan 1972; Pearce et al. 1991), great progress has been made in understanding signal peptide functions. As a highly abundant group of short-chain signal peptides, CRPs play important roles in multiple processes in plants. In addition to their function in resistance to plant pathogen attack (Silverstein et al. 2007; Maróti et al. 2015), CRPs have been found to play crucial roles in various aspects of plant development (Tabata and Sawa 2014). For example, CRPs have been found to participate in plant-bacteria symbiosis (Maróti and Kondorosi 2014), male–female crosstalk during pollen germination and double fertilization (Dresselhaus and Franklin-Tong 2013), root development (Srivastava et al. 2009), and stomatal formation (Kondo et al. 2010), among others. In this study, we isolated and characterized the OsDT11 gene, which encodes a CRP of unknown function, and showed that it could enhance tolerance to drought stress in overexpressing rice plants. These results improve the understanding of the roles of CRPs in drought stress signaling pathways and expand upon the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to abiotic stress in plants.

Previous studies have indicated that some stress-induced proteins confer stress tolerance (Shinozaki et al. 2000). The expression level of OsDT11 was strongly induced by dehydration and salt in this study, and the maximum levels were observed approximately 6 and ^3 h after the PEG and NaCl treatments, respectively. The alterations in the OsDT11 transcript level that were observed under the different environmental stresses suggest that this gene plays a role in the response to abiotic stress. OsDT11 transgenic rice plants were generated, and the overexpressing lines exhibited an obvious improvement in tolerance to drought stress (Fig. 4). Notably, the expression level of OsDT11 was significantly correlated with water loss in the transgenic plants (Fig. 4b, c). These results confirm that the overexpression of OsDT11 enhances drought tolerance in rice. Additionally, the stomatal density of OsDT11-overexpressing plants was lower than that of the wild-type line under drought stress conditions (Fig. 5), which indicates that the overexpression of OsDT11 may improve the ability to retain water by modulating stomatal density. Furthermore, the expression levels of three genes, Dip1, Rab21, and OSE2, which are involved in the stress response, were increased under drought conditions in the overexpressing rice plants (Fig. 6). It has been reported that Dip1 and Rab21 expression is induced by dehydration (Yi et al. 2010). OSE2 is expressed in response to drought and cold temperatures (Rabbani et al. 2003). Therefore, we inferred that the enhancement of drought tolerance in the OsDT11-overexpressing rice might be associated with the priming expression of these stress-responsive genes.

In plants, ABA is one of the most important hormones that function in response to environmental stresses, and it particularly promotes abiotic stress resistance (Mehrotra et al. 2014). In response to drought stress, ABA accumulates and activates a series of genes, resulting in stomatal closure (Schroeder et al. 2001). Here, we found that OsDT11 overexpression reduced the water loss and increased drought tolerance  in  transgenic  plants  (Fig.  4a–c).  Moreover, OsDT11 expression was correlated with tolerance level (Fig. 4). These findings imply that the increased expression of OsDT11 could have allowed for better maintenance of the water balance in the transgenic lines. In addition, we found that OsDT11 activated target genes associated with the ABA signaling pathway or the ABA response, including Rab21, BURP, GRAM, and HVA22 (Figs. 6b, 7a–c; Yi et al. 2010; Gan et al. 2011; Baron et al. 2014; Shen et al. 2001). OsbZIP23 has been characterized as a key regulator of the expression of a number of stress-related genes via an ABAdependent pathway (Xiang et al. 2008), and the expression of OsDT11 has been shown to be down-regulated in the Osbzip23 mutant (Fig.  7d). Similarly, we found that OsDT11 expression was increased in the Os2H16-overexpressing line and decreased in the knockdown line (Fig. 7e). As a regulator that participates in tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses, Os2H16 is thought to be regulated by OsbZIP23 in the ABA signaling pathway (Li et al. 2013a). These data suggest that OsDT11 may function down-stream of O s b Z I P23 and Os2H16. It might be regulated by these two genes in the ABA signaling pathway. Furthermore, the ABA level was affected in the OsDT11 transgenic plants under normal conditions, indicating that OsDT11 may be involved in ABA biosynthesis. In plants, most ABA-responsive genes have ABRE and stress-responsive elements in their promoters, and these elements are significant contributors to the abiotic stress response (Narusaka et al. 2003; Wei et al. 2012). An analysis of the cis-elements located 1500 bp upstream of the OsDT11 promoter sequence revealed the presence of 5 ABRE elements that are ABA responsive and five elements containing TC-rich repeats, MBS and C-repeat/DRE related to drought responsiveness (Table 1). These data suggest that OsDT11 is quite possibly involved in the ABA-mediated stress response.

In conclusion, we have shown that OsDT11 positively regulates tolerance to drought stress in rice and that it is very likely involved in the ABA-dependent stress signaling pathway and ABA biosynthesis. Compared with wild-type ZH11, the overexpression of OsDT11 does not influence other important agronomic traits such as the tiller number, plant height and heading data (data not shown). These results indicate that O s D T I I is a good candidate gene that may be further studied to improve drought tolerance in rice in the future.

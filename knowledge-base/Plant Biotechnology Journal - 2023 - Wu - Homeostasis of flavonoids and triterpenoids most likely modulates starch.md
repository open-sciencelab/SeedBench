# Summary

In angiosperms, the timely delivery of sperm cell nuclei by pollen tube (PT) to the ovule is vital for double fertilization. Penetration of PT into maternal stigma tissue is a critical step for sperm cell nuclei delivery, yet little is known about the process. Here, a male-specific and sporophytic mutant xt6, where PTs are able to germinate but unable to penetrate the stigma tissue, is reported in Oryza sativa. Through genetic study, the causative gene was identified as Chalcone synthase (O S C H S 7) , encoding the first enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis. Indeed, flavonols were undetected in mutant pollen grains and PTs, indicating that the mutation abolished flavonoid biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the phenotype cannot be rescued by exogenous application of quercetin and kaempferol as reported in maize and petunia, suggesting a different mechanism exists in rice. Further analysis showed that loss of OsCHS1 function disrupted the homeostasis of flavonoid and triterpenoid metabolism and led to the accumulation of triterpenoid, which inhibits significantly ùìç -amylase activity, amyloplast hydrolysis and monosaccharide content in xt6, these ultimately impaired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reduced ATP content and lowered the turgor pressure as well. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that OsCHS1 modulates starch hydrolysis and glycometabolism through modulating the metabolic homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids which affects ùìç -amylase activity to maintain PT penetration in rice, which contributes to a better understanding of the function of CHS1 in crop fertility and breeding.

Keywords: rice, pollen tube penetration, starch metabolism, OsCHS1, ùìç -amylase.

# Introduction

Double fertilization, a finely regulated process, is vital for sexual reproduction in angiosperms. To accomplish double fertilization, flowering plants develop pollen tubes (PTs) to deliver sperm cells (Marton and Dresselhaus, 2010). In rice, pollen grains interact with stigmatic papillae to initiate hydration and then germinate PTs on the surface of the hairy papilla. The PTs must penetrate between the papilla cells of plumose stigma and grow continually and then penetrate through the stigma-style interface to enter the stylar transmission tract (STT), subsequently elongate within STT to finally reach the ovule for double fertilization (Ciampolini et al., 2001; Li et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018). Since the STT cells are more compactly arranged than the papilla cells of plumose stigma in rice, the PT penetration of the stigmastyle interface is critical for successful double fertilization (Ciampolini et al., 2001). Although several genes participating in PT penetration, such as AtVanguard1 (VGD1) (Jiang et al., 2005), O-Fucosyltransferase1 (AtOFT1) (Smith et al., 2018), Pollen tube blocked 1 (PTB1) (Li et al., 2013) and OsCNGC13 (Xu et al., 2017), have been reported, the mechanism of how the PT penetration is regulated remains unclear.

The rice PTs have to penetrate these physical barriers (the papilla cells of plumose stigma, the stigma-style interface and STT) and rapidly grow toward the ovule, so where do the driving power and energy for this process come from? Pollen development, PT penetration and growth require a lot of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to provide energy, and mitochondrial respiration and fermentation are the main pathways of energy production (Selinski and Scheibe, 2014). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the key mitochondrial enzyme, is abundant in maize pollen, which catalyses pyruvate to produce acetylCoA and enters the TCA cycle for energy supply (Gass et al., 2005; Thelen et al., 1999). In addition, pyruvate also can enter the ethanolic fermentation pathway to produce energy under the catalysis of pyruvate decarboxylase (Thelen et al., 1999; Wei et al., 2009). To maintain the rapid tip growth and penetration, PTs have to coordinate many cellular processes, such as ATP hydrolysis, osmoregulation, ion fluxes, vesicle trafficking, actin dynamics, synthesis of pectin and proteins and cyclosis (Rounds et al., 2011). The growing PT is an osmotic system, the dynamic change of turgor pressure impacted the PT penetration and growth (Chen et al., 2015). Therefore, maintaining a suitable turgor pressure is very important for PT penetration and growth.

In rice, the main energy of pollen grains is stored as starch in amyloplasts, which provides energy and carbon skeleton structure for both pollen germination (PG) and tube growth (Lee et al., 2016). Pollen grains of Poaceae contain a lot of vesicle-derived granules, termed as polysaccharide particles (Pparticles) by Heslop-Harrison (Heslop-Harrison, 1979), which are closely packed in polyhedral shapes into the pollen grains. Hydrolysis of the P-particles (mainly pectin) produces mostly galactose and arabinose, as well as a small amount of rhamnose and glucose (Heslop-Harrison and Heslop-Harrison, 1982). At the beginning of germination, P-particles produce larger polysaccharide aggregates by fusion, which then pass through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and fuse into the inner wall of the PT. Both secretory vesicles and P-particles are involved in PT growth. In rice pollen, sugar plastids (SPs) are homologous to the P-particles and cannot be stained by iodine-potassium iodide (|_2-ùñ™|) (Wang, 2015). Many SPs, derived from the hydrolysis of amyloplasts in the flowering process, provide energy for PG and tube growth and supply permeable substances to maintain the turgor pressure for PT growth (Wang, 2015). The starch can be hydrolyzed into monosaccharides by amylase and glucosidase (Moran et al., 2011; Yoon et al., 2007), then monosaccharides are catabolized to produce ATP, which gives the organism energy. ùìç -amylase is the main amylase necessary for starch degradation, and the activity of ùìç -amylase can be suppressed by amylase inhibitors. Previous studies reveal that ùìç -amylase inhibitors are used to treat human diabetes and obesity (Ceriello, 2005; Preuss, 2009; Rebolledo and Dato, 2005). Three kinds of triterpenoids (lupeol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid) are found to be inhibitors of ùìç -amylase activity in previous studies (Ali et al., 2006). Amylase inhibitors are generally classified into three categories: pseudosaccharides, glycoproteins and polyphenols (Heidari et al., 2005; McDougall and Stewart, 2005; Tundis et al., 2010). Flavonoids are the main polyphenolic compounds, most of which can inhibit ùìç -amylase activity (Paloma et al., 2012).

Although flavonoids and triterpenoids are derived from different metabolic pathways, they may be metabolically linked through acetyl-CoA (Ben Zvi et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2021; Taiz et al., 2015; Voo et al., 2012). Chalcone synthase (CHS) is the first enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis that combines one molecule of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA to produce naringenin chalcone, which is subsequently cycled by chalcone isomerase to generate naringenin. After that, diverse flavonoids are formed by the action of other enzymes of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (Ferreyra et al., 2012; Heller and Forkmann, 1988). Most extraplastidic terpenoids (including triterpenoids) are synthesized from acetyl-CoA through the cytosolic mevalonate pathway in plants (Bohlmann and Keeling, 2008; Lichtenthaler, 1999). Both malonyl-CoA and mevalonate are produced from acetyl-CoA. Therefore, acetyl-CoA is a common metabolic intermediate, which regulates the metabolic homeostasis between flavonoids and terpenoids (triterpenoids) biosynthetic pathways (Ben Zvi et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2021; Taiz et al., 2015; Voo et al., 2012).

It was reported that the absence of certain flavonoids could impair male fertility in several species, and loss of CHS function affects pollen development, PG and PT growth in maize (Zea mays), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), petunia (Petunia hybrid), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Coe et al., 1981; Mahajan et al., 2011; Mo et al., 1992; Muhlemann et al., 2018; Napoli et al., 1999; Pollak et al., 1993; Schijlen et al., 2007; Taylor and Jorgensen, 1992; Wang et al., 2020). These defects were partially restored with the treatment of kaempferol or quercetin both in vitro and in vivo in some species. It was postulated that flavonoids act as antioxidants to regulate pollen fertility by antagonizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ùñß_2ùñÆ_2 (Muhlemann et al., 2018). On the contrary, loss of CHS function in Arabidopsis has no effect on male fertility at all (Burbulis et al., 1996; Ylstra et al., 1996). These studies suggest that pollen function is regulated differently among species and the mechanisms remain to be elaborated.

Here, we report a PT penetration mutant, designated as xt6 in rice caused by the loss of OsCHS1 as demonstrated through mapbased cloning, RNA-seq analysis, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-edited and genetic complementation lines. The mutant PTs germinate and grow normally on papillar cells as the wild-type (WT) but are unable to penetrate into the stigma, therefore leading to male sterility. Further analysis showed that loss of O S C H S ‚Üë function abolished the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and disrupted the metabolic homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids which affected ùìç -amylase activity and glycometabolism in rice pollen and PTs. The PT phenotype could not be rescued by exogenous application of the flavonols (quercetin or kaempferol) as in other species. Taken together, our data suggest that OsCHS1 most likely enables PT penetration into the stigma by modulating the homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids through modulating starch hydrolysis and glycometabolism. Our findings, therefore, provide novel insights into the mechanisms controlling PT penetration in rice.

# Results

# Identification of a male sterile mutant of rice

To investigate mechanisms controlling male fertility in rice, a mutant xt6 with zero seed setting rate (SST) (Figure 1a) was obtained from a TOS17 mutant library. The vegetative development was normal in xt6 (Figure 1b), and no morphological difference in reproductive organs such as spikelet and floral organ were observed between mutant and WT (Figure 1c,d). Eosin B and |_2^-ùñ™ ùñ® staining showed that embryo sacs (Figure 1e,f) and pollen (Figure 1g,h) developed normally in the mutant. Aniline blue staining for PT indicates that PT germinates and grows normally on the hairy papilla cells in both mutant and WT (Figure 1i,k) when pollinating the WT stigma, but the mutant PT was unable to penetrate into the stigma and stopped at the junction of the hairy papilla and the stigma (Figure 1k) while the WT tubes penetrate the sigma normally (Figure 1i). At 2 h after pollination (HAP), WT PTs had normally reached the micropyle of the ovule (Figure 1j), while the mutant PTs were blocked in the plumose stigma (Figure 1k) and never reached the ovule (Figure 1l). Reciprocal cross further showed that the xt6 PTs just stagnated in WT plumose stigma like the results of xt6 self-cross (Figure 1 ùóÜ,ùóá] ), while WT PTs could normally penetrate the stigma and grow through STT to reach the xt6 micropyles (Figure 1o,p). These indicate that xt6 is a male-specific mutant. In the ùñ•_2 population, there are 701 plants with a normal seed set and 241 plants with no seed set, conforming to a ratio of 3:1 (Table S1). Together, these data suggest that xt6 is a sporophytic mutant controlled by a single recessive gene.

# Pollen tube penetration of xt6 mutant is blocked in vivo

To further investigate whether PT growth is impaired in the mutant, PG assays were conducted both in vitro and in vivo. Most rice pollen will germinate after 2 min on PG medium and almost stop growing after 10 min (Chen et al., 2008). Pollen germination rate (PGR) and PT length of WT and xt6 were determined at 30 min after culture. The results showed that PGR of xt6 (79.0% ,n=981 pollen grains) was not significantly different from PGR of WT (78.3% ,n=1010 pollen grains) (Figure 2a‚Äìc), and the PT length of xt6 (89.6¬†m) ,n=256 pollen grains) was also comparable with that of WT (about 87.4¬†m_¬∑ ,n=256 pollen grains) (Figure 2d). These indicate that PGR and PT growth is not affected by the mutation in vitro. For PT growth experiment in vivo, the WT pistils were fixed after being pollinated by WT or xt6 pollen for 15 and 30 min, respectively. The WT PTs had penetrated stigma into style at 15 ùóÜ ùóÇ ùóá after pollination (MAP) (Figure 2e) and were growing in the style and finally reached the micropyle of the ovule at 30 MAP. However, although all xt6 pollen grains had germinated, the tubes stagnated in the hairy papilla at 15 and 30 MAP (Figure 2f,g). These data suggest that PT penetration into the stigma is compromised in the mutant.

# Cloning of the candidate gene

Since xt6 was derived from the Tos17 mutant library, deep wholegenome resequencing on xt6 was performed to find the insertion site. Five and six insertion sites were detected by software ITIS (Identification of Transposon Insertion Sites) (Jiang et al., 2015) and software RetroSeq (Keane et al., 2012), respectively (Tables S2 and S3), and five of them were the same. Genetic analysis showed that there was no linkage relationship between the six insertion sites and the phenotype of xt6. Thus, the phenotype of xt6 is not caused by the insertion of ùëá ùëú ùë†17 .

To map the target gene locus, we used two ùñ•_2 populations derived from xt6/Chenghui 448 and x t6/931 1 . The candidate gene was mapped to a 1‚àº160¬†ùóÑ ùñª region between the markers √ó15 and √ó19 (Figure S1a), which contains 25 predicted genes in total (Table S4). To determine which one was the target gene, we performed PCR amplification of the 25 genes in WT and mutant xt6, the results showed that 24 consecutive genes of them were deleted in xt6 (Table S5). In addition, a large fragment deletion (Chr. 11: 19.195‚Äì19.376 Mb, Figure S1b) was found in the genomic sequence of xt6 mutant through IGV_2.8.9 (Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013), an efficient viewer for resequencing reads in BAM files. These results indicate that the large fragment deletion may lead to the phenotype of xt6 mutant.

To further identify the target gene, we pollinated the WT lines with WT and xt6 pollen grains, respectively, and collected the plumose stigmas at 15 MAP for high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, respectively. RNA-seq analysis showed that 7 genes (LOC_Os11g32500, LOC_Os11g32650, LOC_Os11g32720, LOC_Os11g32750, LOC_Os11g32759, LOC_Os11g32780 and LOC_Os11g32810) were detected among the 25 candidate genes of map-based cloning. However, only the expression level of LOC_Os11g32650 changed significantly (P value: 2.53E-10) in xt6 and was down-regulated to 0.19-fold of that in WT (Table S6). This reveals that LOC Os11g32650 is most likely the target gene. LOC Os11g32650 is predicted to encode the rice OsCHS1.

# OsCHS1 mutation results in pollen tube penetration defects

To confirm whether OsCHS1 is the causal gene leading to the mutant phenotype, a construct, including the full-length CDS, the upstream 2509 bp and the downstream 1566 bp genomic DNA sequence of OsCHS1, was made and transformed into the mutant xt6. Twenty transgenic lines, named DJ5, were obtained. Phenotypic analysis showed that DJ5 develop and grow normally as the WT (Figures 3a‚Äìg and S2a), suggesting the xt6 sterile phenotype was restored. Furthermore, the CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing was performed. Six homozygous lines containing six types of mutations were obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 editing (Figure S2b). The first two types of mutations were deletions of base G49 (49th -G) and G46-C47 (46th and 47th - GC) that caused a frame shift, leading to a premature stop codon after the 74th and 62nd amino acid, respectively. The other four types of mutations were base insertions which insert a G, double T, a C and a G after the 49th (49th+6) , 48th (48th+Œ†) , 47th (47th+C) and 47th (47√∑ h+G) bases of the coding region that caused a frame shift, resulting in a stop codon after the 63rd, 75th, 63rd and 63rd amino acid, respectively. All six types of mutations produced short peptides with unknown functions (Figure S2c). The phenotype analysis on S g 7 7 (derived from the progenies of oschs1-cr-17, 49th -G/49th -G and CAS9-free) and oschs1-cr-4 (T0, 49th -ùñ¶/48ùóç ùóÅ+ùñ≥ùñ≥) plants, showed that the mutation phenotypes were consistent with that of xt6 (Figures 3 and S2d‚Äìh; Table S7). In addition, the SST of WT, xt6, DJ5 and sg17 plants is 93.9% ,0.4% ,94.6% and 0.2% (Figure S2a), respectively. These results suggested that O S C H S ‚Üë was the gene responsible for an abnormal PT penetration phenotype of xt6 mutant.

# Expression patterns of OsCHS1

To examine the expression pattern of OsCHS1, OsCHS1pro::GUS (- -glucuronidase) reporter was constructed and introduced into WT rice plants. GUS staining showed that OsCHS1 was expressed in various tissues, including root, culm, leaf, inflorescence, pistil (stigma) and anther (Figure S3a‚Äìj). OsCHS1 gene was expressed preferentially in root stele, stem, leaf and pistil and was also detected in young panicles and young anthers, but hardly detectable in mature pollen (Figure S3a‚Äìj). Consistently, qRTPCR analysis showed that expression of OsCHS1 was relatively strong in stem, leaf, pistil, young panicle and young anther, while was very low in mature anther and background level in pollen grains (Figure S3k). Besides, we did not find the GFP signal in mature PTs of transgenic rice plants containing OsCHS1pro:: OsCHS1-GFP (Figure S3m‚Äìo).

To investigate the subcellular localization of OsCHS1, GFP fusions with O S C H S ‚Üë were constructed and introduced into rice protoplasts. Transient expression analysis showed that OsCHS1 is localized to the cytoplasm, plasma membrane and nucleus (Figure S3l).

# Mutation of OsCHS1 impairs flavonoid biosynthesis in flowers

One of the end products of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is flavonol, which is related to male sterility (Mahajan et al., 2011). Given that CHS1 is the first key enzyme in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, the mutation of OsCHS1 may cause abnormal flavonol synthesis in rice. To test this hypothesis, diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethylester (DPBA), a fluorescent flavonol was used to stain flavonols, to observe the distribution of flavonol in pollen and PT. Strong signals were observed in both pollen and PT as well as pistil from WT, but no fluorescence signals were detected in pollen, PT and pistil of mutants xt6 and sg17 (Figure 4a,b). These indicate that flavonols were absent and the flavonoid biosynthesis is abolished in pollen, PT and pistil of the mutants.

Moreover, the analysis of flavonoid metabolomes in pollen of WT and xt6 was carried out by LC‚ÄìMS. In total, 21 flavonoid compounds were detected in WT pollen, 11 of which were almost absent in xt6 pollen (Figure 4c). According to the principle that each compound has a specific retention time (rt) after comparison with the standard sample, the absent compound 301, 178 and 193 in xt6 were identified as naringenin chalcone, quercetin with one hexose molecule, and kaempferol with one hexose and one deoxyhexose molecule in WT pollen, respectively (Figure 4d). Consistent with the result of DPBA staining, flavonoid contents were significantly reduced due to the mutation of OsCHS1. On the other hand, coumaric acids and derivatives, hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, triterpenoids, phosphosphingolipids and macrolactams are increased significantly in the mutant (Figure 4e). These data suggest that the loss of OsCHS1 function not only impairs flavonoid biosynthesis but also impacts other cellular metabolisms in rice.

To investigate whether the lack of flavonoids and flavonols caused the male phenotype as it was previously reported that the pollen growth phenotype can be restored by exogenous application of kaempferol and quercetin in CHS mutant plants in petunia and maize (Mo et al., 1992; Pollak et al., 1993), similar experiments were performed several times in rice xt6 mutant. No success can be achieved (Figure S4a). Furtherly, the exogenous application of monosaccharide (1¬†ùñ¨,5¬†ùñ¨ and 10¬†M glucose) and ATP (1 nM, 5 nM and 10 n M) (Figure S4b) could not rescue the growth defects of xt6 PTs in vivo. Furthermore, ROS production in xt6 is also comparable with that of the WT pollen grains and PTs (Figure S4c‚Äìe), no aberrant ROS production reported in maize and tomato chs mutant pollen was observed in rice. This suggests that mechanisms independent of ROS accumulation exist in rice.

# Starch hydrolysis is impaired in xt6 pollen tubes

To better understand how the blocked PT penetration was caused, the ultrastructure of mature pollen grains was analysed by electron microscopy (EM). And it was found that the overall morphology, the structure of both exine and germination pore in xt6 pollen was the same as that in WT (Figure 5a‚Äìd). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that amyloplasts and SPs were present in WT and xt6 pollen. Large amyloplasts were concentrated near the germination pores and the small SPs were enriched far from the germination pores in both WT and xt6 pollen grains (Figure 5e,f). Only the large amyloplasts close to the germination pore could be stained by ùñ®_2-ùñ™ùñ® both in WT and xt6 (Figure 5g,h). Further observation revealed that the WT ùñ≤ ùñØ ùñ≤ appear round-shaped with a regular light-dense structure inside (Figure 5i,k) , while the SPs of xt6 were irregular in shape with dispersed dense structure (Figure 5j,l). To further confirm the phenotypic differences in starch particles of WT and xt6 mutant pollen, we measured the length-width ratio of SPs and found that the length-width ratio of WT ùñ≤ ùñØ ùñ≤(1 .19,n=943) was significantly lower than that of x t6 SùñØ ùñ≤ (1.39, n=813 ) (Figure S5a), and 82.7% (673/814) of xt6 SPs were abnormal (marked by red arrows in Figures 5l and S6b,d). Additionally, the normal ùñ≤ ùñØ ùñ≤ as in WT pollen are observed in DJ5 pollen (Figure S6a,c), and the anormal SPs as in xt6 pollen are also found in s g7 pollen (Figure S6b,d). These results indicate that there are obvious differences in ùñ≤ ùñØ ùñ≤ structure between xt6/sg17 and WT/DJ5 pollen, and WT/DJ5 ùñ≤ ùñØ ùñ≤ are more circular and regular than x t6/s g 7 5ùñØ ùóå

To further investigate the behaviour of SPs in PT tips, TEM analysis was carried out on PTs. In the early stage of PG, a large number of ùñ≤ ùñØ ùñ≤ fused at the tip of PTs to form polysaccharide aggregates (Figure 5m,n). Subsequently, the wall precursor formed by the polysaccharide aggregates adhered closely to the inner wall of the PT (Figure 5o,p) and then gradually fused with it and eventually became part of the PT wall (Figure 5q,r). During these processes, no significant difference between xt6 and WT was observed. The PT wall could be formed normally in both xt6 and WT. The starch granules or amyloplasts in WT tubes contain degraded (dense matrix-like structure, grey area) and undegraded (white area) starch (Figure 5s), and a large area of amyloplasts of WT tubes is grey, indicating a high degree of starch hydrolysis (Figure 5s), while 84.3% (640/759) of amyloplasts from xt6 tubes are almost white (marked by red arrows in Figures 5t and S6f,h), indicating a low degree of starch hydrolysis. Similarly, highly hydrolyzed amyloplasts as in WT tubes are observed in DJ5 tubes (Figure S6e,g), and lowly hydrolyzed amyloplasts as in xt6 tubes are also found in s g 7 tubes (Figure S6f,h^ ). These suggest that starch hydrolysis in xt6 PTs is much slower than that in WT PTs, which implies that starch hydrolysis may be inhibited in xt6 PTs.

# xt6 has abnormal starch hydrolysis and glycometabolism

It was reported previously that flavonoids inhibit the activity of ùìç -amylase during starch hydrolysis (Lee et al., 2010). In view of the structural variation of SPs in xt6 pollen and the decreased starch hydrolysis in xt6 PT, it is plausible to speculate that the impaired flavonoid biosynthesis caused by the mutation of OsCHS1 might affect the activity of ùìç -amylase. To confirm that, the activity of ùìç -amylase in WT and xt6 pollen were measured using 3,5- dinitrosalicylic acid and spectrophotometry (Hashemi et al., 2013). The results revealed that the activity of ùìç -amylase in xt6 and s g 7 pollen grains was significantly reduced compared with that in WT and the O S C H S‚Üë complemented DJ5 lines (Figure 6a), while the ùìç -amylase activity of DJ5 (Figure 6a) was no different from the WT. Consistently, the starch content of xt6 and sg17 pollen grains was significantly accumulated compared with that in WT and DJ5 pollen (Figure S5b). Besides, the ùìç -amylase extracted from WT was treated with the methanol extract of WT and xt6 pollen, respectively, and it was found that the methanol extract of xt6 pollen significantly inhibited the ùìç -amylase activity, and the degree of inhibition was higher than that of the methanol extract of WT pollens (Figure 6d), suggesting that there may be other ùìç -amylase activity inhibitors besides flavonoids in the methanol extract of x t6 mutant pollen. Since flavonoids have been greatly reduced in the xt6 mutant pollen (Figure 4c), amounts of other inhibitors should be increased to make the effect of the inhibitor in the xt6 mutant greater than that of WT. Considering that triterpenoids were previously reported to be inhibitors of ùìç -amylase (Ali et al., 2006), and that triterpenoids were significantly accumulated in the xt6 mutant pollen (Figure 4e), we further compared the inhibitory effects of flavonols (Chalcone, quercetin and kaempferol) and three commonly used triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupeol) on ùìç -amylase. Our experiments showed that three triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupinol) could significantly inhibit the activity of ùìç -amylase, and their inhibitory effect was even stronger than that of flavonols (Figure 6e). These data indicate that ùìç -amylase activity is significantly reduced by mutation of O S C H S ‚Üë , possibly due to the accumulation of triterpenoid inhibitors in the xt6 mutation.

Given that glucose is the product of complete hydrolysis of starch, we hypothesized that the reduced ùìç -amylase activity in xt6 would have an impact on the glycometabolism. To verify this hypothesis, sugar metabolome on WT and xt6 pollen was performed with four biological replicates per group. A total of 18 glycometabolic compounds were detected (Figure 6b), among which the contents of fructose, glucose, pyruvate, malic acid and oxaloacetic acid were significantly different between WT and xt6 (P<0.05) . These 18 glycometabolic compounds can be divided into four categories: monosaccharides (rhamnose, fructose and glucose), glycolysis pathway (glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6- phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, 3-phosphoglyceric acid and pyruvate), pentose phosphate pathway (erythrose-4- phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate and sedoheptulose-7- phosphate) and TCA cycle (citric acid, isocitric acid, aketoglutaric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid and oxaloacetic acid). Subsequently, by summing all compounds in each category separately, the results showed that xt6 pollen has lower monosaccharide content, reduced TCA cycle (P=0.021 )and enhanced glycolysis pathway (possibly because of the abnormal accumulation of pyruvate caused by weakened TCA cycle) (Figure 6c). This indicates that the mutation of OsCHS1 suppresses the metabolic pathway from starch to monosaccharides and disrupts glycometabolism in xt6 pollen.

Now that the TCA cycle, a major energy supply process, was significantly (P=0.021<0.05) reduced in xt6 mutant pollen compared with that in WT pollen, we further examined the ATP content and ATP/ADP ratio among WT, xt6, DJ5 and S g 7 7 pollen. As expected, the ATP content of xt6 and sg17 pollen decreased dramatically compared with that of WT and DJ5 pollen (Figure 7a ). Similarly, the ATP/ADP ratio of xt6 and sg17 pollen was significantly lower than that of WT and DJ5 pollen (Figure 7b). In addition, compared with WT, the turgor pressure of xt6 pollen was significantly lower as well (Figure 7c). Considering the difference in monosaccharide and ATP content between WT and xt6 pollen, we repeated the exogenous application experiments and found the exogenous application of monosaccharide (1, 5 and 10¬†M glucose) and ATP (1, 5 and 10 ùóá ùóÜ) (Figure S4b) could not rescue the growth defects of xt6 PTs in vivo, this may be because the exogenous application of glucose and ATP cannot be absorbed and utilized by the xt6 PTs. Based on all the results, we propose a working model (Figure 7d) that OsCHS1 regulates PT penetration. Briefly, in xt6 mutant, the absence of O S C H S ‚Üë disrupted the homeostasis of flavonoid and triterpenoid metabolism and led to the accumulation of triterpenoid which inhibits significantly aamylase activity, amyloplast hydrolysis and monosaccharide content, these ultimately impaired TCA cycle, reduced ATP content and lowered the turgor pressure as well. Finally, xt6 PTs were unable to penetrate the stigma due to insufficient energy supply.

# Discussion

Previous studies have shown that flavonoids are associated with male sterility in several species, such as maize, tomato, petunia, rice and tobacco (Coe et al., 1981; Mahajan et al., 2011; Mo et al., 1992; Muhlemann et al., 2018; Napoli et al., 1999; Pollak et al., 1993; Schijlen et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2018; Taylor and Jorgensen, 1992; Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2017), but not in Arabidopsis. These data suggest that different mechanisms may exist for the role of flavonoids in fertility. Here we showed that OsCHS1 is required for the penetration of PTs into the stigma and has no role in pollen development, PG, and PT growth in rice, which is different from those in maize, tomato and petunia (Coe et al., 1981; Mo et al., 1992; Napoli et al., 1999; Pollak et al., 1993; Schijlen et al., 2007; Taylor and Jorgensen, 1992). Interestingly, exogenous application of quercetin and kaempferol on the stigma can rescue the fertility deficiency of chs mutants in those species but has no effect on the rice xt6 mutant (Figure S4a). The exogenous application treatment experiments were successfully performed in maize, tomato and petunia, but since their flower and pollen characteristics are different from those of rice, we repeated this experiment many times in accordance with the method of exogenous application of IAA in rice to restore PT growth defects (Zhang et al., 2018). Nevertheless, there is a caveat that in vitro application of quercetin and kaempferol cannot restore the abortion phenotype of xt6. It is possible that a combination of different types of compounds (flavanones, flavonols, flavones and flavone Cglycosides) appeared to be important for rice male fertility, not just flavonols in several species as previously reported (Wang et al., 2020). In addition, pollen from chs mutant is partially functional in petunia and maize (Mo et al., 1992); however, pollen grains from xt6 are completely sterile on pistil containing or not containing flavonoid. On the contrary, pollen grains from WT are absolutely fertile on flavonol-free xt6 pistil. This suggests that flavonols are not required at least for pollen‚Äìpistil interaction in rice. In Arabidopsis, chs mutation has no effect on fertility at all (Burbulis et al., 1996; Ylstra et al., 1996), indicating that flavonoids are not necessary for Arabidopsis fertility. These indicate that the mechanism by which OsCHS1 controls PT penetration into the stigma in rice is distinct from that in Arabidopsis, maize, tomato and petunia.

ROS has been shown to play a role in male gametophyte development, PG, PT growth and PT rupture during fertilization (Muhlemann et al., 2018). Plants take advantage of a variety of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants to maintain the homeostasis of ROS, including flavonols and anthocyanin metabolites in the flavonoid family (Mittler, 2002; WinkelShirley, 2001). In tomatoes, it was proposed that flavonols could reduce ROS accumulation, promote normal PG and PT growth and rescue sterile phenotype of chs mutant (Muhlemann et al., 2018). In rice, lack of flavonols in xt6 mutant does not affect ùñß_2ùñÆ_2 content in pollen and PT in xt6 mutant (Figure S4c‚Äìe). This indicates that the phenotype of retarded PT penetration in xt6 is likely independent of ROS accumulation, implying that OsCHS1 regulates PT penetration through different mechanisms other than ROS.

(d) A proposed working model of OsCHS1 modulates starch hydrolysis and glycometabolism through modulating the metabolic homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids to maintain PT penetration. In WT pollen, amyloplasts are hydrolyzed into sufficient sugar plastids under the catalysis of proper {x_¬†‚òæ -amylase activity. After normal metabolism, the PT grows normally in the pistil until the micropyle end to complete double fertilization. In xt6, however, flavonoids synthesis route is blocked by the absence of O S C H S ‚Üë , the significantly increased content of triterpenoids inhibited the activity of amylase, and the accumulation of precursors of coumaric acids and hydroxycinnamic acids may also inhibit the activity of amylase, resulting in the weakened amylase activity, the reduced degree of amyloid hydrolysis, the reduced content of sugar plastid and the reduced content of glucose in xt6 compared with WT. In addition, the enhanced glycolysis process leads to the accumulation of pyruvate products, causing a decrease of oxaloacetic acid and malate contents, the key compounds in the TCA cycle, which ultimately weaken TCA cycle, reduced ATP content and lowered the turgor pressure as well, thus resulting in the stagnation of PT penetration in xt6 and the failure to reach the micropyle ends to complete double fertilization.

Pollen from different species uses distinct ways (lipid, sugar and starch) to store energy. Rice pollen adopted starch as energy storage. A typical characteristic of rice pollen is starch accumulation, which is commonly used as a marker for pollen viability. In rice pollen grains, many SPs are produced by the hydrolysis of amyloid during flowering, providing energy for PG and PT growth (Wang, 2015). TEM observation showed that the SPs structure of xt6 pollen was different from that of WT, and the degree of amyloplast hydrolysis in xt6 PTs was lower than that in WT PTs. Therefore, we speculated that the starch hydrolysis in xt6 pollen might be affected by the mutation of O S C H S ‚Üë . Given that aamylase is the main amylase necessary for hydrolysis of amyloplasts into ùñ≤ ùñØ ùñ≤ , we tested the activity of ùìç -amylase in WT and xt6 pollen and found that the ùìç -amylase activity in xt6 pollen was significantly lower than that in WT. LC‚ÄìMS analysis showed that 13 of the 14 flavonoids with altered content displayed a decreased trend, 11 flavonoids of which were almost undetectable in xt6 pollen grains (Figure S7). Flavonoids, the inhibitor of aamylase (Paloma et al., 2012), were reduced dramatically in xt6 pollen, however, the ùìç -amylase activity in xt6 pollen was significantly reduced compared with WT. Consistently, the aamylase extracted from WT was treated with the methanol extract of WT and xt6 pollen, respectively, and it was found that the methanol extract of xt6 pollen significantly inhibited the aamylase activity, and the degree of inhibition was higher than that of the methanol extract of WT pollens (Figure 6d). This indicates that there may be other ùìç -amylase inhibitors besides flavonoids in xt6 mutant pollen. Previous reports suggested triterpenoids (including lupeol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid) were inhibitors of ùìç -amylase (Ali et al., 2006). LC‚ÄìMS analysis revealed that the contents of 39 compounds significantly declined and the content of 25 compounds significantly rose in xt6 pollen grains, among these 64 compounds (14 kinds of flavonoids and 50 other compounds) with changes (Figures 4e and S7). This suggests that the mutation of OsCHS1 can also affect the metabolism of other related pathways. Furthermore, two kinds of triterpenoids were found in the increased 25 compounds, and their levels were 1.8-fold and 1.3-fold higher than that in WT, respectively (Figure 4e). Our experiments also showed that three triterpenoids (lupeol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid) could significantly inhibit the activity of ùìç -amylase (Figure 6e). For technical reasons, unfortunately, comp256 and 227 could not be identified as which specific triterpenoids. In addition, we used four compounds (Poaceatapetol, Xue et al., 2018; oleanolic acid; ursolic acid and lupeol) as standards to test the WT and mutant pollen by GC‚ÄìMS and found that none of them were detected. These four compounds might not be detected in pollen because they are modified. Because there are no suitable standards, we are currently unable to determine which triterpenoids comp256 and 227 are, further investigation is needed. In xt6, the flavonoid synthesis pathway is blocked due to the deletion of CHS1, coumaric acids and derivatives and hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, the precursors of chalcone-synthase substrate (4- coumaryl-CoA), were significantly accumulated (Figure 4e). They are also polyphenolic compounds and may have an inhibitory effect on ùìç -amylase (Funke and Melzing, 2006; Paloma et al., 2012). The blockage of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway also resulted in a significant increase in the content of triterpenoids (Lichtenthaler, 1999), which reduces ùìç -amylase activity in xt6. In addition, there may be increased levels of other ùìç -amylase inhibitors in xt6 pollen due to metabolic disorders caused by the loss of CHS1. In conclusion, it is most likely that _C H S7 deficiency affected the metabolic homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids, resulting in reduced ùìç -amylase activity in xt6 pollen. Decreased ùìç -amylase activity results in reduced starch hydrolysis, then a reduction in monosaccharides content (glucose). Due to the enhanced glycolysis, the end product pyruvate is accumulated. Secondary metabolites can be synthesized from pyruvate through a series of reactions (Wang et al., 2007). The increased pyruvate content may also affect the dynamic balance between pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, malate and oxaloacetic acid (Petushkova and Tsygankov, 2017) and cause a reduction of malate and oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid is a key compound for starting or restarting the TCA cycle, so the TCA cycle, a major energy supply process, is likely reduced. Consistently, our experimental result showed that the ATP content, which provides energy to cells, in xt6 and sg17 pollen was decreased dramatically compared with WT and DJ5 pollen (Figure 7a), furthermore, the ATP/ADP ratio of xt6 and sg17 pollen was significantly lower than that of WT and DJ5 pollen (Figure 7b). In addition, the turgor pressure of xt6 pollen was significantly lower as well (Figure 7c). In summary, abnormal SPs structure, decreased monosaccharide content, increased pyruvate content and reduced TCA cycle imply that the energy metabolism and turgor pressure in xt6 PT have been disrupted. Rice PTs penetrate between the papilla cells of plumose stigma after germination and then grow in the intercellular space of transmitting tissue of the style (Li et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2017). The stylar cells are more compactly arranged than plumose stigma cells (Ciampolini et al., 2001). Lack of energy and change of turgor pressure (Chen et al., 2015) might be the reason why xt6 PTs could hardly penetrate into the stigma and finally stagnates in plumose stigma.

Our data showed that the xt6 pollen grains germinate PTs that grow normally in vitro. This is different from a previous report where oschs1 pollen exhibited reduced germination rate and PT length (Wang et al., 2020). This may be due to the difference in PG conditions, such as the medium composition and pollen grains density. Indeed, similar to xt6, the rates of PG and tube growth are similar in atoft1 and WT in vitro, while the PT penetration of oft1 is significantly delayed compared with WT in vivo (Smith et al., 2018), although there are many differences in pistil structure between rice and Arabidopsis. In addition, cell wall dynamics is also critical for PT penetration. The loss of AtVGD1 reduced the activity of pectin methylesterase in pollens, impaired cell wall degradation in female tissues, then severely inhibited the PT growth in STT and finally decreased male fertility (Jiang et al., 2005). It was also proposed that OsCNGC13 facilitates the penetration of PTs in the style through regulating extracellular matrix component (EMC) modification, STT cell death and stylar cytoplasmic ùñ¢a^2+ accumulation for fertilization (Xu et al., 2017). Stylar cytoplasmic (a^2+ may act as a perceived guidance cue, and the regulation of EMC modification and STT cell death may reduce physical resistance in PT penetration. In addition, PTB1 is also a positive regulator (Li et al., 2013), and functional interruption of O S C H S ‚Üë caused early arrests of PT penetration.

In conclusion, we propose a metabolic model in that OsCHS1 modulates starch hydrolysis and glycometabolism by modulating the metabolic homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids which affects ùìç -amylase activity to maintain PT penetration (Figure 7d). This work provides not only a new insight into the molecular mechanism controlling PT penetration but also a potential male sterile material for rice breeding.

# Materials and methods

# Plant materials and growth conditions

The xt6 mutant was obtained from TOS17 mutant library in the Nipponbare (Oryza sativa ssp. Japonica cv.) background. Two mapping populations, xt6/Chenghui 448 and xt6/9311, were used. The sg17 mutant was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology (Lu et al., 2017). The plants were planted in the experimental field of Beijing and Hainan under natural conditions.

# Phenotypic characterization

Mature embryo sacs of WT and xt6 were examined according to the method previously reported (Wu et al., 2020). Pollen viability and PT behaviour were investigated by |_2^-ùñ™| staining and aniline blue staining, respectively (Chen et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020). The stained materials were observed using a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2 Plus, Zeiss) under UV light.

For SEM and TEM observations, mature pollen grains and pistils at various MAP were prepared according to the previous methods (Chen et al., 2007; Jia et al., 2017).

# Pollen tube germination and growth in vitro

Pollen grains from just dehiscent anthers were germinated on a 35-m m dish at 28^‚àòC for 30 min in a Pollen Germination Medium (PGM: 1 mM KCl, 0.5 mM ùñ¢ ùñ∫ ùñ¢ ùóÖ_2, 0.01 % (w/v) ùñß_3ùñ° ùñÆ_3, 18% (w/v) sucrose, 1 % (w/v) low-melt agarose) as described by Han et al. (2011) with modifications. The PG rate and PT length were counted with Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus fluorescence microscope.

# Map-based cloning

Homozygous mutant xt6 plants were crossed with Chenghui448, and mutant individuals were collected from 1873¬†ùñ•_2 plants. The candidate gene was mapped primarily to a 4ÃÉ Mb physical region between the markers √ó17ùñ¨ and √ó2010 on chromosome 11 and further restricted to a‚àº770¬†kb region between the markers √ó40.1 and X21 (Figure S3a). To further narrow down the candidate region, a larger ùñ•_2 population (18 477 plants) of xt6/ 9311 was used and the candidate gene was finally localized to Œî‚àº160¬†ùóÑ ùñª region between the markers X15 and X19 (Figure S3a). The genomic DNA was isolated with the CTAB method. The primers used for the mapping were listed in Table S8.

# RNA-seq and data analysis

The WT plumose stigmas pollinated with WT and mutant pollen at 15 MAP were collected, respectively, and total RNA was extracted with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). Three biological replicates were performed. RNA-seq analysis was performed by Novogene (Beijing, China). The clean data were obtained by removing reads containing adapter, reads containing poly-N and low-quality reads from raw data and aligned to the reference genome using TopHat v2.0.12. Clean data was analysed with CUFFLINKS software (Trapnell et al., 2012). Genes in mutant whose expression changed at least twofold compared with the WT were defined as differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate, FDR <0.05 ).

# qRT-PCR analysis

Total RNA was extracted from different tissues and reversetranscribed into first-strand cDNA using FastQuant RT Super Mix Kit (#KR108; TIANGEN). qRT-PCR was performed using SuperReal PreMix (SYBR Green) Kit (#FP204-02; TIANGEN) by a C1000 TouchTM Thermal Cycler (#785BR05170, Bio-Rad). OsUBQ5 was used as the internal control. Three biological replicates were performed. The primers used for qRT-PCR were listed in Table S9.

# Construction and transgenic analysis

For genetic complementation, the vector pCAMBIA1300-OsCHS1 (including the whole CDS, the upstream and the downstream genomic DNA sequence of OsCHS1) was constructed with Gibson Assembly (Gibson et al., 2009). Genotype identification of transgenic plants and their progeny was performed by PCR. To analyse the expression pattern of OsCHS1, a vector OsCHS1pro:: GUS (including the upstream 2509 bp genomic DNA sequence of OsCHS1 and GUS sequence) was constructed using Gibson Assembly. The genetic transformations were performed by Biogle Biotechnology. The method of GUS staining on different tissues of transgenic plants was used as previously reported (Chen et al., 2007). Images were obtained by using Axioskop 2 Plus microscope (Zeiss). For the subcellular localization of OsCHS1, p S A T6-E G F P-O s C H S1 and p S A T6-O s C H S1-E G F P were generated for transiently transforming the rice protoplast. Subsequent transfection was performed as reported previously (Zhang et al., 2011). Besides, the plasmid OsCHS1pro::OsCHS1-GFP (including the upstream 2509 bp genomic DNA sequence of OsCHS1 and GFP sequence) was generated for exploring the subcellular localization of OsCHS1. The primers used for construction were listed in Table S9.

# Flavonoid metabolome

Twenty-five mg of pollen grains from just dehisced anthers were collected by a vacuum cleaner to perform flavonoid metabolomic analysis according to the method previously reported (Bian et al., 2020). Briefly, pollen grains were extracted with 1 m L 80% (V/V) methanol solution, and the metabolic extracts (2¬†L) were detected with a UHPLC‚ÄìMS/MS system consisting of an electrospray (6550) quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer and an Agilent (1290) Infinity LC pump.

# Measurement of  -amylase activity, ATP content, ATP/ ADP ratio and starch content in pollen

Briefly, 10¬†ùóÜ ùóÄ of pollen grains from just dehisced anthers were collected by a vacuum cleaner and crushed by adding 200¬†L glass beads (Sigma) and 800¬†L double-distilled water ( d d H_2O) by a TissueLyser (QIAGEN) at 30 ùñß ùóì , 5 min, then let sit at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged for 10 ùóÜ ùóÇ ùóá at 12 000 rpm, RT. Then the supernatant was collected to measure ùìç -amylase activity using the ùìç -amylase Activity Testing Kit (BC0615, Solarbio) and ATP content using Enhanced ATP Assay Kit (S0027, Beyotime) by a SpectraMax Paradigm MultiMode detection platform (Molecular Devices), respectively.

For ATP/ADP ratio assay, 10 of pollen grains from just dehisced anthers were collected to measure ATP content according to the above method, then added 10¬†L of 1√ó ADP Converting Enzyme to measure ADP content according to the instruction of ADP/ATP Ratio Assay kit (ab65313, Bioluminescent). Lastly, ATP/ADP ratio was calculated using the value of ATP content and ADP content. To detect the starch content, 10 mg of pollen grains from just dehisced anthers were collected and crushed by adding 200¬†L glass beads (Sigma) and 600¬†L lysis buffer by a TissueLyser (QIAGEN) at 30¬†ùñß ùóì,¬†5¬†ùóÜ ùóÇ ùóá , then the sample was extracted at 80^‚àòùñ¢ for 15 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 g. , RT. Then the precipitate was collected to measure starch content using the Starch Content Detection Kit (BC0705, Solarbio) by a SpectraMax Paradigm Multi-Mode detection platform (Molecular Devices).

# Sugar metabolome

Fifty milligrams of pollen grains from just dehisced anthers were collected for sugar metabolome. The lipids were removed from the samples using the improved Bligh/Dyer extraction method (two extractions) and obtained the upper aqueous phase containing sugar and small-molecule metabolites (Song et al., 2020). After drying with a vacuum concentrator, the samples were redissolved in 50% acetonitrile solution containing a mixture of isotopelabelled standards. Isolation was performed on a ThermoFisher DGLC3000 using a ThermoFisher Accucore 150-Amide HILIC :100 √ó 2.1  mm ,2.6¬†m; ) column, and then quantitative analysis was carried out on the Sciex QTRAP 6500 Plus system using electrospray ionization mode by referencing to spiked internal standards including d4-citric acid, d3-malic acid, d4-succinic acid, d3-pyruvate, 7-glucose, ^13 C_3 -fructose, ^13 C_12 -sucrose, ^13 C_6^- glucose-6-phosphate, ^13C_6 -fructose-6-phosphate, ^13C_6 -fructose1,6-bisphoshate, ^13 C_12 -maltose, ^13C_6 -UDP-glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory) (Shi et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020).

# DPBA staining of pollen grains, tubes and pistils

To detect flavonols, mature pollen grains, pistils and PTs 30¬†ùóÜ ùóÇ ùóá after germination were stained, respectively, with 2.5 m g/ùóÜ ùñ´ DPBA and 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100 according to the previous method (Muhlemann et al., 2018). The stained pollen grains and PTs were observed at Ex458 nm/Em472-615 nm with CLSM 780 (Carl Zesis), and the stained pistils were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (M205 FA; Leica).

# Determination of ùñß_2ùñÆ_2 in pollen grains and tubes

To detect ùñß_2ùñÆ_2, mature pollen grains and PTs 30¬†ùóÜ ùóÇ ùóá after germination were stained, respectively, with 50¬†M 30-O-Acetyl6^' -O-pentafluorobenzenesulfonyl- .2^'-7^' -difluorofluorescein (BESùñß_2ùñÆ_2 -Ac) as previously protocol (Maeda, 2008). The stained pollen grains and PTs were observed at Ex488 nm/Em493- 556 nm with CLSM 780 (Carl Zesis). To quantify ùñß_2ùñÆ_2 content, 100¬†ùóÜ ùóÄ of pollen freshly dispersed from anthers were collected and measured using the H_2 O_2 content determination kit (BC3595, Solarbio) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions, by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop 2000c; Thermo Scientific).

# Flavonol treatment

To investigate the role of flavonols on PTs, flowers were treated with quercetin and kaempferol as described by Mo et al. (1992) with modifications. The mutant flowers 2-h before dehiscence were emasculated and soaked for 5 min in 2, 20, 50 and 100¬†M of quercetin and kaempferol mixture (1:1), monosaccharide (1, 5 and 10¬†M glucose) and ATP (1, 5 and 10 ùóá ùóê ), respectively. 0.1 Œ©^ùñ¨ PBS (ùóâ ùñß 7.0) solution containing 1 % DMSO was used as control. The treated pistils were pollinated manually with mutant pollen and fixed with FAA at 4ùñß ùñ† ùñØ for aniline blue staining. Alternately, when flowering, the panicles of xt6 mutant were sprayed immediately with different concentrations of quercetin and kaempferol mixture (1:1), monosaccharide and ATP, respectively (Zhang et al., 2018). One hour after spraying, the treated spikelets were labelled and collected for aniline blue staining.

# Turgor pressure measurement

The turgor pressure of pollen grains was measured with a crushing centrifugal method. Ten milligrams of pollen grains from just dehisced WT and xt6 anthers were collected by a vacuum cleaner and crushed by adding 200¬†L glass beads (Sigma) and 600¬†L lysis buffer (Enhanced ATP Assay Kit, S0027, Beyotime) by a TissueLyser (QIAGEN) at 30 ùñß ùóì. , 5 min. The samples were centrifuged for 10 ùóÜ ùóÇ ùóá at 12, 000 rpm. Then the supernatant was collected for osmolality measurement using the lysis buffer as the control. The osmolality was measured by Osmo310 Osmometer (YASN).

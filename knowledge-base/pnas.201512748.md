Grain size is one of the key factors determining grain yield. However, it remains largely unknown how grain size is regulated by developmental signals. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a dominant mutant big grain1 (Bg1-D) that shows an extra-large grain phenotype from our rice T-DNA insertion population. Overexpression of BG1 leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism. In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of BG1 results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains. Moreover, BG1 is specifically induced by auxin treatment, preferentially expresses in the vascular tissue of culms and young panicles, and encodes a novel membrane-localized protein, strongly suggesting its role in regulating auxin transport. Consistent with this finding, the mutant has increased auxin basipetal transport and altered auxin distribution, whereas the knockdown plants have decreased auxin transport. Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield. Taking these data together, we identify a novel positive regulator of auxin response and transport in a crop plant and demonstrate its role in regulating grain size, thus illuminating a new strategy to improve plant productivity.

grain size | Big Grain1 | auxin | biomass | grain yield Bcultivated worldwide, improvement of grain yield is a major focus of rice-breeding programs (1). Grain size is one of the determining factors of grain yield (2, 3). A number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rice grain size have been identified in recent years (4‚Äì11). However, functional mechanisms of these genes remain largely unknown. Because QTLs usually have important functions in determining grain size, many of them have been widely selected in breeding processes or existed in modern elite varieties, and a certain QTL could be only applicable in certain varieties (12). Thus, exploration of new grain size-associated genes and elucidation of their functional mechanisms have great significance for further improvement of rice yield (12).

Seed size, as well as other organ size, is controlled by various plant hormones, such as auxin, brassinosteroid, and cytokinin (10, 13, 14). A number of studies have demonstrated that auxin plays a vital role in organ size determination by affecting cell division, cell expansion, and differentiation (15‚Äì17). Auxin exists predominantly as indole-3- acetic acid (IAA) in plants, and genetic studies of its biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis have demonstrated that IAA regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, including stem elongation, lateral branching, vascular development, and tropic growth responses (18, 19). Combined with biochemical studies, the tryptophan (Trp)-dependent IAA biosynthesis pathway has been clearly established involving the YUCCA family flavin monooxgenases (20). Importantly, the two-step pathway is highly conserved throughout the plant kingdom (21). Until very recently, the Trp-independent auxin biosynthetic pathway was elucidated as contributing to early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis (22). Primary auxin signaling is a rapid process initiated from the hormone perception by receptor TIR1, an F-box protein, followed by degradation of the negative regulator AUX/IAA proteins, and further release the downstream auxin response factors (ARFs) (23‚Äì26). However, how the ARFs work in plants remains elusive. Auxin transport, generally referring to the cell-to-cell transportation of the hormone directed basipetally from shoots to roots in vascular tissues, plays a critical role in auxin response (18). The transport involves a number of membrane-associated proteins, such as PINs (protein inhibitor of nNOS), AUX1 (AUXIN TRANSPORTER PROTEIN 1), and ABCBs (ATPBINDING CASSETTE, SUB-FAMILY B PROTEINS) as efflux or influx carriers (27‚Äì30). Disruption of auxin transport induced by either gene mutations or chemical inhibitor treatment will lead to diverse development defects, such as decreased lateral organ initiation and defective tropic growth responses (27, 31‚Äì34).

In this study, we identify a rice mutant, named big grain1- ¬∑ D (B g l-D) because it is a dominant mutant having extralarge grain size. BG1 encodes a novel plasma membrane-associated protein, and is specifically induced by auxin treatment. We show that BG1 is a new positive regulator of auxin response involved in auxin transport, and demonstrate that manipulation of BG1 expression can greatly improve grain size and plant productivity.

# Results

Bg1-D Shows Increased Grain Size Phenotype. We have identified a number of rice mutants with altered grain size from our T-DNA

# Significance

As one of the most important growth-promoting hormones, auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. Understanding auxin action has long been a challenging task because of the complexity of the hormone transport involved in auxin response. Despite tremendous progress made in Arabidopsis, auxin response and transport are poorly understood in crop plants, which impedes the application of hormone knowledge in agricultural improvement. This study not only identifies a novel positive regulator of plant growth in rice and demonstrates its significant role in improving seed size and grain yield, it also illustrates the specific involvement of the plasma membrane-associated protein in regulating auxin response and transport, thus illuminating a new strategy for enhancing crop productivity.

insertion population. Among them, B g l-D has the most obviously increased grain size (Fig. 1A). Compared with WT (Nipponbare, Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), the 1,000-grain weight of B g l-D has increased about 33.8% , with the grain length and grain width increased about 15.2% and 17.0% , respectively (Fig. 1B ). Observation of spikelet hull by scanning electron microscopy showed that the epidermis cells of both palea and lemma in B g l-D are much longer than that of the WT (Fig. S1). Careful examination of the hull cross-section before flowering revealed significant increases of both number and area of the parenchyma cells in the B g l-D mutant (Fig. 1 C and D ). Consistent with this, a number of genes associated with cell cycle and cell expansion were up-regulated in the panicles of the B g l-D mutant (Fig. S2).

Despite the greatly enlarged grain size, B g l-D also exhibits enhanced growth of other tissues at both the vegetative and reproductive stages (Fig. 1E and Fig. S3). One-week-old seedlings of the B g l-D mutant have obviously increased length of leaf and root compared with WT (Fig. S3 A-DŒ© ). When plants enter reproductive stage, the leaves of B g l-D are longer and wider than those of the WT plants, and the B g l-D also has increased plant height (Fig. 1E , Fig. S3E, and Table S1). In addition, the B g l-D panicles are much larger than those of the WT (Fig. S3 F and G ).

We also compared the fresh and dry weights of seeds between the B g l-D and WT, and found that the weight of B g l-D endosperms was markedly increased compared with that of WT at 15 days after fertilization, and the difference reached a maximum at 25 days after fertilization (Fig. S4). Thus, the significant overall improvement of the grain weight in the B g l-D mutant is attributed to the increases in both hull size and endosperm volume.

Molecular Cloning of BG1. Genetic analyses showed that F_1 progenies of the reciprocal crosses between B g l-D and WT have big grain phenotype (Fig. S5A). In addition, the phenotype of B g l-D cosegregates with the T-DNA insertion in the F_2 population, and the segregation ratio is ‚àº3:1 (Fig. S5B), suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by a T-DNA insertion, which activates the expression of BG1. We cloned the T-DNA 3^' -flanking sequence by the site-finding PCR method based on thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (35, 36). Sequence analysis revealed that a T-DNA was inserted at 0.8 ¬†kb upstream of the gene Os03g0175800 (Fig. 2A). Additional gene-expression analysis showed that, whereas other adjacent genes of the insertion site have comparable transcript levels in the mutant and WT, this gene has increased expression ‚àº10 -fold in the B g l-D mutant (Fig. 2B). Thus, O s O3g O I758O O is potentially the gene responsible for the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes and was designated as BG1.

BG1 Is a Novel Positive Regulator That Controls Grain Size. The fulllength cDNA of BG1 was amplified by 5^' RACE, which is 1,190 bp in length and contains an ORF of 933 bp encoding 330 amino acids. To verify that activation of BG1 is responsible for the mutant phenotype, we overexpressed BG1 cDNA under the control of the rice ACTIN1 promoter in WT and found that the BG1- overexpressing plants (B G I-O E) showed obviously increased grain size and other phenotypes, such as enhanced plant height, longer leaves, and larger panicles, which resemble the B g l-ÃÖD mutant phenotypes (Fig. 2C and Fig. S6 A and B ). Importantly, severity of the phenotypes was apparently correlated with the _B G l expression level; that is, plants with higher _B G I expression have bigger grain size as well as increased 1,000-grain weight (Fig. 2 D-G ), demonstrating that activation of _B G l is the cause for the B g l-D mutant phenotypes.

Suppression of BG1 by RNA interference (B G l-R i) led to obviously opposite phenotypes, including reduced plant height and decreased panicle length and grain size, as well as reduced 1,000-grain weight (Fig. 2 H-K and Fig. S6 C and D ). The phenotype severity is also consistent with the BG1 expression level, suggesting that the native BG1 indeed controls grain size and plant growth in rice.

Molecular Characterization of BG1. BLAST search of the protein databases discovered a number of orthologous proteins of BG1 in various higher plants. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the proteins can be classified into two subgroups: dicot- and monocot-specific groups (Fig. S7). However, none of them has been functionally characterized, including four Arabidopsis BG1-like proteins. Moreover, no known functional domain in these proteins could be found, suggesting that BG1 is a novel plant-specific regulator controlling organ size.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that _B G l transcripts can be detected in various tissues, but the expression is relatively stronger in culms and panicles, and the level is gradually decreased as the panicle matures (Fig. 3A). We also analyzed the BG1 promoter activity in various tissues of P R O_B G I:GUÃáS transgenic plants. GUS staining revealed that the _B G l promoter is specifically active in the vascular tissues of leaves, culms, and hulls (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization of developing hulls demonstrated the preferential expression of _B G l in hull vascular tissues with a gradual decrease as the development progressed (Fig. 3B and Fig. S8E).

BG1 Is Localized to the Plasma Membrane. Because BG1 encodes a novel protein without known sequence characteristics, we first investigated the protein subcellular localization. A 35S:BG1-eGFP vector containing eGFP-tagged BG1 was introduced into WT rice, and transgenic plants displayed obvious phenotypes similar to the B g l-D mutant (Fig. S8A-C) ), indicating that the fused BG1-eGFP is functional. GFP fluorescence observation using roots as material showed that the protein is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this finding, we also obtained a similar result in rice protoplasts transformed with the same vector (Fig. S8D). To confirm these results, we separated the microsomes of the transgenic plants and then detected the proteins by anti-GFP antibodies. Immunoblotting results showed that BG1-eGFP can be obviously detected in the microsomal pellets, but only a very faint signal was observed in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3D ). An additional two-phase partitioning assay demonstrated that the BG1-eGFP protein was highly enriched in the plasma membrane fraction, but not in the other membrane‚Äôs fractions (Fig. 3E ).

BG1 Is a Primary Auxin Response Gene. To investigate whether phytohormones affect BG1 transcription, we analyzed _B G I expression in WT seedlings under the treatment of various hormones. After ^2-h application of hormones, we found that _B G I is specifically induced by IAA, but not by others (Fig. 4A). An additional time-course analysis revealed that the _B G l transcript level was rapidly induced within 30 min of IAA application and the expression reached the maximum with ‚àº eightfold of that without hormone treatment after 4-h treatment (Fig. 4B). The IAA-induced accumulation still occurred in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting that the induction does not rely on protein synthesis (Fig. 4C). Moreover, IBA (indole-3-butyric acid) and NAA (naphthylacetic acid) (two other auxin compounds) can also induce the expression of _B G I , but to a less extent, whereas tryptophan (a structurally similar molecule to IAA) failed to induce _B G I accumulation (Fig. 4D ), showing no hormonal activity. These results strongly suggest that _B G I is a novel specific and primary auxin response gene. Consistent with this, we found that B g l-D had increased sensitivity to IAA in term of root elongation/inhibition and, in contrast, B G I-R i plants had greatly decreased sensitivity to IAA (Fig. 4E and Fig. S9A), demonstrating that BG1 is involved in auxin response.

BG1 Is Involved in Auxin Transport. In _B G l -overexpression plants, a number of lines with high expression levels of _B G I showed obviously enlarged tiller angles (Fig. 4 F and G ), a phenotype associated with perturbed auxin transport (33). Combined with the membrane localization of the BG1 protein and the induction of _B G I by auxin treatment, these results strongly imply that BG1 is involved in auxin transport. Strikingly, we further observed that these _B G I -overexpressing lines have obvious defects in tropic growth at the young seedling stage. When their seeds were sowed on agar culture media, with a high frequency, both the roots and the shoots grew in a slanting direction, and in some cases the roots even grew upward, resembling the NPA (N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor)-treated phenotype (Fig. 4H and Fig. S9B). To test whether the B g l-D mutant also has altered gravitropism response, we treated the B g l-D mutant, WT, and B G I-R i plants with 0.1¬†M NPA and then compared their phenotypes (Fig. 4I and Fig. S9C). In plant shoots, whereas a few of the WT plants had slightly oblique growth under low concentration of NPA, B G l-R i plants had normal growth. In contrast, ‚àº35% of B g l-D mutant shoots grew downward into the culture medium. In roots, NPA strongly inhibited the lateral root initiation in all of the three plants. However, compared with those without treatment, the root tip numbers of WT, B g l-D , and BG1-Ri plants were repressed to 2ÃÖ1ÃÖ.8% ,17.7% , and 37.3% , respectively (Fig. 4J), indicating that the NPA effect is more remarkable on B g l-D but less on B G I-R i than on WT. In conclusion, B g l-D has increased sensitivity to NPA, whereas BG1-Ri has decreased sensitivity. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that BG1 is involved in auxin transport.

Bg1-D Exhibits Altered IAA Distribution and Transport. D R5:G U S has been widely used as a reporter to study endogenous auxin distribution (37). To study whether activation of _B G I caused altered auxin distribution, we crossed the D R5:G U S plants to B g l-D ,and then analyzed the D R5 promoter activity in the double mutant by GUS staining. Compared with the D R5¬∑G U S plants where the GUS signal was mainly detected at the apex area in both roots and spikelets, the GUS expression in the B g l-D mutant was more intense and covered a much broader area, indicating that the B g l-D mutant had enhanced auxin distribution in these tissues (Fig. 5.A and B ). Consistent with this finding, the IAA level was markedly increased in the panicles of the B g l-D mutant compared with WT (Fig. 5C). In addition, we directly measured the basipetal IAA transport in the coleoptiles of dark-grown seedlings of WT, Bg1- ¬∑ D , and B G I-R i plants. Compared with the WT, the B g l-D mutant had an ‚àº50% increase in the basipetal IAA transport, whereas BG1-Ri had decreased transport (Fig. 5D] ), further confirming that BG1 is involved in auxin transport.

Manipulation of BG1 Increases Plant Biomass and Grain Yield. Because activation of BG1 leads to a marked increase in grain size and grain weight, we tested whether _B G I can be applied to improve grain yield. We found that most of the _B G l -overexpressing plants, including the B g l-D mutant, have insignificant change of grain yield per plant because of a lower percentage of full matured grains compared with the WT plants, which may be caused by ectopic expression of _B G l under a strong constitutive promoter. To deal with this problem, we introduced the _B G I gene into WT plants using a 3.6-kb genomic fragment containing the 2-kb native promoter and the entire coding region of _B G I , as well as a 667 bp downstream sequence. Consistent with the predominant role of BG1 in panicle development, the transgenic plants showed obviously increased grain size and larger panicle without other obviously negative effects (Fig. 6 A‚ÄìC). Statistical analysis showed that the 1,000-grain weight of two lines, O E-5 and OE-7, increased 15.48% and 2ÃÖ5.38% , respectively, and the grain yield per plant increased 6.69% and 16.65% , respectively, compared with WT (Fig. 6 D and E ). An additional field trial test showed that the actual yield per plot (15¬†m^2) of both transgenic lines had increased about 15.1% and 20.8% , respectively (Table S2).

Despite the increased grain weight, overexpression of _B G I also significantly enhanced plant biomass, with the highest about 18% increase of dry weight in three analyzed lines (Fig. S10A). In contrast, the BG1-Ri lines showed greatly decreased biomass. In addition, we also generated a 35S¬∑BÃÖG I vector and introduced it into Arabidopsis (Columbia, Col-0), and found that overexpression of _B G I in Arabidopsis also resulted in greatly increased seed size and enhanced growth at both vegetative (Fig. S10 B and C ) and reproductive (Fig. 6 F and G ) stages, suggesting that _B G I is also functional in dicots. Considering that orthologs of BG1 exist in many other plant species, including sorghum, Medicago, maize, and soybean (Fig. S7), BG1 may have extensively practical roles in improving plant biomass and grain productivity in various species.

# Discussion

Several lines of evidence support the involvement of BG1 in auxin transport. First, BG1 is localized to plasma membrane, expresses in vascular tissues, and is induced by auxin treatment. These characteristics are reminiscent of typical auxin transport genes, such as PINs (28, 38). Second, B g l-D has increased sensitivities to both auxin and NPA, whereas B G I-R i has decreased sensitivities. Severe _B G I -overexpressing lines have obviously defective gravitropism growth. Third, B g l-D has obviously enhanced basipetal auxin transport, whereas BG1-Ri has decreased auxin transport. Therefore, it is very likely that BG1 plays an important role in controlling plant growth and development through regulating auxin transport. In Arabidopsis, auxin transport regulates a number of processes associated with cell expansion or division, including hypocotyl elongation, shade avoidance, and stamen filament elongation (39‚Äì42). In rice, overexpression of a small auxin-up RNA (SAUR) gene SAUR39 reduces auxin transport, resulting in abnormal shoot and root growth and altered shoot morphology compared with WT plants (43). In addition, mutation of the NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1) gene reduces polar auxin transport activity, leading to reduction in leaf size and stem length (44). Recently, NAL1 has been identified as an important QTL regulating grain yield by three independent studies (45‚Äì47). Near-isogenic lines carrying a gain-of-function allele of NAL1, as well as the gene overexpressors, have increased leaf length, panicle size, and grain productivity. Importantly, this allele has been selected in high-yield rice-breeding process. Although the detailed mechanism of NAL1 function remains unclear, these results suggest a potential of modulating auxin transport in improving grain yield. Our study provides direct evidence that strengthened auxin transport caused by activation of BG1 leads to enhanced growth, whereas suppression of _B G I weakens auxin transport, resulting in reduced growth. Interestingly, although B g l-D exhibits an overall enhanced growth in different tissues, the most significant change is the increased grain size and grain weight. Because grain weight depends to a large extent on the hull development and endosperm maturation, the role of auxin transport in coordination of this process needs to be further investigated.

So far, the detailed relationship between auxin transport and auxin signaling remains unclear. It appears that auxin transport determines its distribution, where auxin exerts its function through auxin signaling. However, abundant studies have demonstrated that a regional gradient of hormone concentrations, resulted by polar auxin transport and local auxin biosynthesis, is important for auxin-mediated developmental processes (48, 49). Consistent with this idea, BG1-Ri plants have obviously decreased IAA sensitivity. In addition, transcripts of both BG1 and PINs are greatly induced by auxin treatment, and it has been shown that PINs up-regulation is dependent on AUX/IAA-mediated signaling pathway (38). We also found there are two auxin response elements in the BG1 promoter, implying that BG1 might be regulated by ARF. Thus, the auxin transport and auxin signaling may form a regulatory loop to stimulate each other, leading to a rapid and efficient auxin response (50, 51).

Because BG1 has no obvious membrane localization peptide sequence and hydrophobic regions, it seems unlikely that BG1 directly transports auxin. BG1 may interact with other membrane-localized auxin transporters, such as members of PIN, AUX1/LAX, or ABCB families (28, 29, 49), to modulate their activities or to facilitate the auxin transport. Several factors involved in vesicular trafficking or phosphorylation modification were reported to regulate PIN function (52, 53). A BIG protein has also been found to modulate PIN localization (54). Interestingly, whereas both BG1 and PIN appear to be involved in auxin transport, it is unexpected that some BG1-overexpressing plants have a similar phenotype as OsPIN1-knockdown plants, which also have enlarged tiller angles as well as enhanced NPA sensitivity (55). One possibility is that BG1 functions in a way different from PINs to regulate auxin transport. Mutation of L A Z Y I also leads to enlarged tiller angles with enhanced basipetal auxin transport (33). Further investigation on the relationship between BG1 and these transportassociated components is essential to elucidate the BG1 functional mechanism.

Although auxin was discovered more than 80¬†y ago and has been demonstrated to play important roles in many aspects of plant growth and development, in rice both auxin signaling and transport are poorly understood. Thus, identification of a novel auxin transport regulator in rice has great significance for understanding of auxin biology in monocotyledon. Although the mechanism for BG1 regulation of auxin transport remains elusive, this study establishes a connection between auxin transport and grain size, and demonstrates the feasibility of modulating auxin transport to enhance grain productivity, thus illuminating a new strategy to improve plant yield.

        "question": "esulting knockout lines (KO-GL10) harbored a frameshift mutation that caused premature termination of translation (Fig. S4A and S4B). These KO-GL10 lines exhibited significantly decreased grain length, grain width, and 1000-grain weight compared to those of the HJX74 wild-type line (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E). In addition, heading date differed significantly between KO-GL10 and HJX74 (Fig. S4C), although we found no detectable differences in plant height, effective tiller numbers, or grain number (Fig. S4DeS4F). We also generated a genetic complementation construct for GL10 overexpression in the NIL-gl10 background via transformation with a p35S-GL10 vector (Fig. S5A and S5B). The GL10 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased grain length and grain weight compared to that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. 2B, 2F, 2G, 2H). Moreover, OE-GL10 grain phenotypes were distinct from that of KO-GL10 plants, with grain length and heading date positively correlating with GL10 expression level.

In addition, we found no significant differences between OE-GL10 and NIL-gl10 in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant (Fig. S5DeS5F).

        "question": "The lic-2 mutant showed an increased leaf and tiller angle (Wang et al., 2008). We then crossed rela with the lic-2 mutant and found that the phenotypes of the rela/lic-2 double mutant were similar to those of the rela mutant (Figure 5D), implying that the function of OsLIC is dependent on OsRELA. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expression level of OsILI1, the direct downstream target of OsLIC, was reduced in both the rela and rela/lic-2 mutants (Figure 5E). The elevated expression level of OsILI1 and the increased leaf angle in the lic-2 mutant are consistent with what has been reported previously, suggesting that the regulation of OsILI1 expression by OsLIC is dependent on OsRELA.\nOsLIC regulates OsILI1 expression through the dependence on ________.",

        "question": "To analyze the salt-tolerant phenotypes of SR86 and Nipponbare (Nip), SR86 and Nip rice were treated with different concentrations of salt. In the 150 mM NaCl treatment, SR86 plants showed a survival rate of 70%, while Nip showed no survival (Fig. 1A–D). To mine the salt tolerance-related genes in SR86, 30 extremely salt-tolerant and 30 extremely salt-sensitive plants were selected from the F(2) progeny of the SR86 × Nip cross, and mixed bulks were generated. BSA-seq analysis revealed salt tolerance related candidate region on chromosome 4, chromosome 8 and chromosome 12 (Fig. 1E). Based on the threshold line, chromosome 4 was judged to have the relevant to the target trait (Fig. 1E). Functional annotation analysis revealed that this region contained a putative salt stress-related gene, LOC_Os04g03320. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis suggested that the expression level of LOC_Os04g03320 was significantly higher in SR86 than that in Nip in the 150 mM NaCl treatment (Fig. 1F).

        "question": "The ability of seeds to germinate under high salinity conditions is an important indicator of salt tolerance [53]. Germination experiments were performed using the seeds of WT plants, Osjrl45 mutant lines (KO1 and KO2), and OsJRL45-OE lines (OE1 and OE2) under control (0 mM NaCl) and salt treatments (100 and 200 mM NaCl) (Fig. 4C–E). Under normal conditions, the WT, KO1, KO2, OE1, and OE2 genotypes showed no difference in the seed germination rate and seedling growth (Fig. 4C). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, compared with the WT, the shoot and root lengths of knockout mutants seedlings were significantly reduced, while those of overexpression lines seedlings were significantly increased (Fig. 4C-E). Under 200 mM NaCl stress, the KO1 and KO2 lines showed seed germination but almost no seedling growth (Fig. 4C-E).Next, we analyzed the salt tolerance of WT and all knockout and overexpressed transgenic rice at the seedling period. Under normal conditions, the WT, KO1, KO2, OE1, and OE2 genotypes showed no difference (Fig. 5A). Under salt stress, the knockout plants indicated severe wilting, while the overexpressed plants grew better than WT plants (Fig. 5A). The chlorophyll content, fresh weights and dry weights of KO1 and KO2 plants were significantly lower after treatment than before treatment, while the chlorophyll contents of OE1 and OE2 plants were lower and their fresh weights and dry weights were significantly higher (Fig. 5C-E). The survival rates (Fig. 5B), chlorophyll contents (Fig. 5C), fresh weights (Fig. 5D), and dry weights (Fig. 5E) of knockout plants seedlings were significantly lower than those of the WT plants, while those of overexpressed transgenic rice seedlings were higher under salinity stress treatments. Collectively, these results suggest that OsJRL45 positively regulates salt tolerance at the germination and seedling stages.To elucidate its biological function, the OsJRL45 gene isolated from SR86 was transformed into the salt-sensitive indica cultivar L6-23. The promoter of OsJRL45 was cloned into the pCAMBIA1300 vector, and the resultant construct was transformed into L6-23 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to create transgenic rice (named Lh).

One gene (Loc_OS02g49410) showed preferential expression in the panicle and endosperm (Supplemental Figure 1). These findings indicated that different members of the OsHAP3 family have different functions in the rice lifecycle. To check the spatio-temporal expression of Ghd8 under LD conditions, RNA in situ hybridization was performed with roots, young leaves, stems, and young panicles of NILHR5. Ghd8 was highly expressed in the phloem of leaves, the vascular system of the stem, and especially in cells of the inflorescence meristem. The inflorescence meristem formed bracts and inflorescence branches (Itoh et al., 2005), which probably determined panicle size (Supplemental Figure 2).\nAmong the three OsHAP3 genes that were highly expressed in all tested organs at various developmental stages, one gene (Loc_OS02g49410) demonstrated a preferential expression in the ________ and endosperm.",

        "question": "To determine the temporal and spatial expression patterns of TAC4, we introduced a construct, consisting of a 2175-bp TAC4 promoter fused to the GUS reporter gene, into the japonica cultivar Nipponbare. GUS staining of the transgenic plants indicated that TAC4 was expressed in almost all the organs, including root, culm, leaf sheath, tiller base and young panicle (Figure 3a–j). Consistent with the GUS staining data, a quantitative real-time PCR analysis also showed that TAC4 was ubiquitously expressed in various rice organs, with the most abundant expression occurring in the young panicle, lamina joint, leaf sheath pulvinus and internode (Figure 3k). TAC4 mRNA in situ hybridization showed that a high TAC4 transcript abundance could be detected in the axillary and shoot apical meristem at the tillering stage (Figure 3l–o). RNA-sequencing data showed TAC4 transcripts in both the lower and upper sides of tiller bases, and the expression levels were similar (Figure S5). The high expression of TAC4 was also detected in the tiller base during the whole growth period (Figure S6).

Among them, 8 Ehd1-OX and 11 Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines at T1 generation were flowering earlier than wild type under NDs (two representative lines of each genotype were shown in Fig. 4, A and B), demonstrating that overexpression of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the later flowering phenotype of ABF1V.To measure and compare the flowering times between Ehd1OXand Ehd1-OX/ABF1V, two independent lines of each genotype expressing equal levels of Ehd1-Flag protein were selected for the investigation (Fig. 4C). The results showed that Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines were flowering about 4 d later than Ehd1-OX lines grown in NDs. This slight flowering difference might be due to the dosage effect of Ehd1 mRNA, because the transcription of endogenous Ehd1 was suppressed in Ehd1-OX/ABF1V but not in Ehd1-OX. Alternatively, ABF1V may not repress flowering in a manner entirely dependent on the Ehd1 pathway. Furthermore, we tested if ABF1E accelerates flowering through enhancing Ehd1 expression. In total, 18 and 15 Ehd1-RNAi transgenic lines in wild-type background (Ehd1R)and ABF1E-1 background (Ehd1RNAi/ABF1E) were generated, respectively. Among them, 15 Ehd1R and 12 Ehd1R/ABF1E lines at T1 generation were similarly flowering later than wild type under NDs (two representative lines of each genotype were shown in Supplemental Fig. S4), demonstrating that knockdown of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the early flowering phenotype of ABF1E.

The results showed that Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines were flowering about 4 d later than Ehd1-OX lines grown in NDs. This slight flowering difference might be due to the dosage effect of Ehd1 mRNA, because the transcription of endogenous Ehd1 was suppressed in Ehd1-OX/ABF1V but not in Ehd1-OX. Alternatively, ABF1V may not repress flowering in a manner entirely dependent on the Ehd1 pathway. Furthermore, we tested if ABF1E accelerates flowering through enhancing Ehd1 expression. In total, 18 and 15 Ehd1-RNAi transgenic lines in wild-type background (Ehd1R)and ABF1E-1 background (Ehd1RNAi/ABF1E) were generated, respectively. Among them, 15 Ehd1R and 12 Ehd1R/ABF1E lines at T1 generation were similarly flowering later than wild type under NDs (two representative lines of each genotype were shown in Supplemental Fig. S4), demonstrating that knockdown of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the early flowering phenotype of ABF1E. Taken together, our molecular and genetic results support the hypothesis that OsABF1 regulates flowering time through the Ehd1mediated flowering pathway.demonstrating that OsABF1-RNAi attenuates drought delay of flowering. Together, these results suggested that OsABF1 and OsbZIP40 function redundantly in mediating drought inhibition of flowering through the Ehd1 pathway.\nThe minor variation in blooming could be attributed to the dosage impact of ________ mRNA.",

        "question": "The seed germination test is routinely performed to evaluate the range of pollutant concentrations producing plant growth and development inhibition (OECD, 1984, EPA, 1986, APAT, 2002). In this study, maize seeds were exposed to increasing concentrations of chromium, ranging from 2 to 1500 ppm, and after 72 h the number of germinated seeds was counted and root lengths were measured. The percentage germination index (IG) in Fig. 1 was computed from combined data. Reduction of growth parameters was scored for all concentrations tested; at low potassium dichromate concentration (2–20 ppm) the damage was not fatal. An IG of 30% was observed at exposures of 50–100 ppm. Consistent growth inhibition was observed starting from 300 ppm of potassium dichromate (Fig. 1) with the highest inhibition occurring at 1200 ppm. These data indicate that maize is less sensitive to chromium than other plants species such as Trifolium repens (Citterio et al., 2002) or Brassica napus L.

        "question": "The effects of H2O2 on the total thiamine pool and upon the distribution of thiamine compounds in maize seedling leaves were qualitatively similar to those observed for water and salt stress (Fig. 7A). However, the increase in total thiamine was much higher under oxidative stress conditions, and showed nearly a 2-fold up-regulation at the 50 mM H2O2 exposure level. Moreover, the free thiamine levels reached a 3-fold increase compared with normal tissue. Exclusive also to this type of abiotic stress, a regular increase (of up to 200%) in the TMP levels was observed at higher H2O2 concentrations.\n在50 mM H2O2环境下，总硫胺素的上调约为________倍。",

Moreover, in contrast to the EV plants, the contents of Cl? decreased significantly in the roots, stems and leaves of the salt-stressed OEGmADC soybean hairy-root composite plants, while the NO3? contents raised in the roots, and kept at a relatively stable level in the stems and leaves of OEGmADC plants, all these thus lead to the decreases of Cl?/NO3? ratio in the salt-stressed OEGmADC soybean plants (Fig. 8f).\n问题：在盐胁迫条件下，转基因大豆毛状根复合植物中，GmADC基因过表达导致根部的NO3?含量________，而茎和叶中的含量则保持不变。",

        "question": "To evaluate the influence of haplotypes on soybean seed traits, we examined the association between haplotypes and seed oil content in soybean collections. Hap_S has a very low seed oil content but very high seed protein content (Fig.?6d,e). This result was consistent with well-documented characteristics of wild soybean seeds, which are very small, black, have low oil content, but are rich in protein. In cultivated soybeans, Hap_H displayed a high seed oil content and low protein content, whereas Hap_W showed a relatively low seed oil content but high protein content (Fig.?6d,e). With respect to the contrasting seed oil and protein content of Hap_H and Hap_W described above, it is possible that Hap_H and Hap_W may reflect the two classic breeding goals of achieving high oil or high protein varieties, respectively.\n问题：Hap_S单倍型大豆种子的种子油含量极低，而________含量则非常高。\n正确答案：种子蛋白",

        "question": "A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis was conducted to establish groups of homology within the GmMIP gene family. The 66 GmMIPs were classified into various subfamilies including 22 GmPIPs, 23 GmTIPs, 13 GmNIPs, six GmSIPs and two new GmXIPs i.e., uncharacterized isoforms (Fig. 1 and Tables 1 & 2). The GmXIPs might be similar to the novel plant AQP subfamily XIP recently reported in moss [15] and tomato [16]. All the members of the GmPIPs subfamily localized to plasma membranes (Table 1). The predicted localization of members of the GmTIPs subfamily was diverse, and predicted localization included cytosol, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole, mitochondria and chloroplast. From the GmNIPs subfamily, GmNIP1;1 and GmNIP4;1 localized to vacuoles, GmNIP2;2 to extra-cellular structures and the rest to plasma membranes. Two members of the GmSIP subfamily localized to vacuoles and the remainder to plasma membranes. GmXIP1;1 localized to extra-cellular structures and GmXIP1;2 to cytosol. The ka/ks ratio was >1 and 1 for PseudoPIP#3 and PseudoSIP#1, and PseudoPIP#2, respectively.

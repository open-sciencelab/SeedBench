        "question": "Field tests of these plant lines inBeijing in 2018 revealed that OsDREB1C overexpression led to increases in grain yield per plant of 45.1 to 67.6% and in yield per plot of 41.3 to 68.3% compared with wild-type (WT) plants (Fig. 1C). Conversely, OsDREB1C KO resulted in yield decreases (from 16.1 to 29.1% in yield per plant and 13.8 to 27.8% in yield per plot) compared with the WT (Fig. 1, D and E, and table S1). A detailed phenotypic analysis showed that the higher yield of the OsDREB1C-OE lines was mainly attributable to an enhanced grain number per panicle and an increased 1000-grain weight (Fig. 1F and fig. S3C), traits apparently resulting from increased secondary branch number and grain length, width, thickness, and density (fig. S3, A and B and D to K, respectively). The OsDREB1C-OE plants exhibited higher grain yield but reduced strawweight compared withWT plants (Fig. 1G), thus leading to an increased harvest index (the ratio of grain yield to aboveground biomass; Fig. 1H) and raising the possibility that OsDREB1C controls resource allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues. The harvest index of OsDREB1C-OE plants was increased by 40.3 to 55.7%, whereas it was decreased by 22.4 to 33.7% in OsDREB1C-KO plants (table S1). In addition, key grain quality traits were enhanced in OsDREB1C-OE plants, suggesting that yield improvement does not entail a quality penalty (table S2).Leaves of\nOsDREB1C-OE plants contained higher levels\nof photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and\ncarotenoids) compared with WT plants, where-\nas pigment levels were reduced in OsDREB1C-\nKO plants (fig. S7A). Analysis ofleafmesophyll\ncells revealed that both chloroplast number\nand sizewere increased in OsDREB1C-OE plants\n(fig.S7, Band C).. Analysis of carbon and nitrogen distribution showed that the OsDREB1C-OE plants accumulated more carbon and nitrogen in the grains, but less in their mature leaves, without substantial alterations in the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (Fig. 3H and fig. S11).",

        "question": "We field-tested 2 or 3 T1 families randomly selected from T0 plants. Compared with the negative segregants, elevated DEP1 accumulation increased the grain length by 6.85–9.58% with a normal plant stature. However, plants overexpressing dep1 showed very similar phenotype to DEP1Ri plants, both of which reduced grain length by ~4.5%, together with dwarf stature and erect panicles (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). The expression level of endogenous DEP1 in dep1OE was not reduced (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Thus dep1 showed a dominant-negative effect over DEP1 in regulating grain size rather than cosuppression of the two genes. In contrast to DEP1OE, GS3-1OE showed an average 9.07% reduction in grain length together with reduced plant stature, very similar to the phenotype of dep1OE (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). GS3-4OE produced even smaller plants and grain size with an average 19.10% reduction of grain length relative to the negative segregant, while GS3-1Ri resulted in an average 5.78% increase of grain length. These results were similar to those of Mao et al39.It was shown that knocking out DEP1 in the GS3-1OE or GS3-4OE background did not further reduce the gain size of GS3-1OE or GS3-4OE (Supplementary Fig. 2d). We also crossed DEP1OE with GS3-1Ri and GS3-1OE transgenic plants. Further increased grain length was observed when overexpressing DEP1 in GS3-1Ri background, whereas the DEP1OE/GS3-1OE hybrid showed the GS3-1OE phenotype of short grain (Supplementary Fig. 2e).GS3 in grain size regulation was to repress the effects of DEP1 and GGC2 on increasing grain size.",

        "question": "Among them, Bg1-D has the most obviously increased grain size (Fig. 1A). Compared with WT (Nipponbare, Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), the 1,000-grain weight of Bg1-D has increased about 33.8%, with the grain length and grain width increased about 15.2% and 17.0%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Observation of spikelet hull by scanning electron microscopy showed that the epidermis cells of both palea and lemma in Bg1-D are much longer than that of the WT (Fig. S1). Careful examination of the hull cross-section before flowering revealed significant increases of both number and area of the parenchyma cells in the Bg1-D mutant (Fig. 1 C and D). Consistent with this, a number of genes associated with cell cycle and cell expansion were up-regulated in the panicles of the Bg1-D mutant (Fig. S2). Despite the greatly enlarged grain size, Bg1-D also exhibits enhanced growth of other tissues at both the vegetative and reproductive stages (Fig. 1E and Fig. S3). One-week-old seedlings of the Bg1-D mutant have obviously increased length of leaf and root compared with WT (Fig. S3 A–D). When plants enter reproductive stage, the leaves of Bg1-D are longer and wider than those of the WT plants, and the Bg1-D also has increased plant height (Fig. 1E, Fig. S3E, and Table S1). In addition, the Bg1-D panicles are much larger than those of the WT (Fig. S3 F and G).we overexpressed BG1 cDNA under the control of the rice ACTIN1 promoter in WT and found that the BG1overexpressing plants (BG1-OE) showed obviously increased grain size and other phenotypes, such as enhanced plant height, longer leaves, and larger panicles, which resemble the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes (Fig. 2C and Fig. S6 A and B). Importantly, severity of the phenotypes was apparently correlated with the BG1 expression level; that is, plants with higher BG1 expression have bigger grain size as well as increased 1,000-grain weight (Fig. 2 D–G), demonstrating that activation of BG1 is the cause for the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes.",
        "answer": "The Bg1-D variant of Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica shows significantly increased grain size, with a 33.8% increase in 1,000-grain weight, and 15.2% and 17.0% increases in grain length and width respectively. The variant also exhibits longer epidermis cells and increased parenchyma cells in the hull, and up-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle and expansion. Despite the enlarged grain size, Bg1-D also shows enhanced growth in other tissues at both vegetative and reproductive stages, with increased leaf and root length, plant height, and larger panicles. Overexpression of BG1 cDNA in wild type plants resulted in similar phenotypes, with severity correlating with BG1 expression level, indicating that BG1 activation is responsible for the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes.",

        "question": "Similarly, highly hydrolyzed amyloplasts as in WT tubes are observed in DJ5 tubes (Figure S6e,g), and lowly hydrolyzed amyloplasts as in xt6 tubes are also found in sg17 tubes (Figure S6f,h). These suggest that starch hydrolysis in xt6 PTs is much slower than that in WT PTs, which implies that starch hydrolysis may be inhibited in xt6 PTs.the a-amylase extracted from WT was treated with the methanol extract of WT and xt6 pollen, respectively, and it was found that the methanol extract of xt6 pollen significantly inhibited the a-amylase activity, and the degree of inhibition was higher than that of the methanol extract of WT pollens (Figure 6d), suggesting that there may be other a-amylase activity inhibitors besides flavonoids in the methanol extract of xt6 mutant pollen. Since flavonoids have been greatly reduced in the xt6 mutant pollen (Figure 4c), amounts of other inhibitors should be increased to make the effect of the inhibitor in the xt6 mutant greater than that of WT. Considering that triterpenoids were previously reported to be inhibitors of a-amylase (Ali et al., 2006), and that triterpenoids were significantly accumulated in the xt6 mutant pollen (Figure 4e), we further compared the inhibitory effects of flavonols (Chalcone, quercetin and kaempferol) and three commonly used triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupeol) on a-amylase. Our experiments showed that three triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupinol) could significantly inhibit the activity of a-amylase, and their inhibitory effect was even stronger than that of flavonols (Figure 6e). These data indicate that a-amylase activity is significantly reduced by mutation of OsCHS1, possibly due to the accumulation of triterpenoid inhibitors in the xt6 mutation.",

The methanol extract of xt6 pollen significantly inhibited a-amylase activity more than the extract of WT pollen, indicating the presence of other inhibitors besides flavonoids. Despite the reduction of flavonoids in xt6 mutant pollen, the inhibitory effect is greater, suggesting an increase in other inhibitors. Triterpenoids, which were found to be significantly accumulated in the xt6 mutant pollen, were identified as potential inhibitors of a-amylase. The inhibitory effect of three triterpenoids was stronger than that of flavonols, indicating that a-amylase activity might be reduced in the xt6 mutation due to the accumulation of triterpenoid inhibitors.",

        "question": "Compared with the wild type, plant height of the afd1 mutant reduced by 27%, 20% and 14% at the seedling stage, tillering stage and maturation stage, respectively (Figures 1A–D, S1). When rice plants reach maturity, the 2nd, 3rd,4th and 5th internodes showed no differences, but the 1st internode was distinctly shorter in the afd1 mutant (Figure 1D, E).Taken together, we concluded that the lodicule was prone to transformation of the lodicule into the hull and has acquired the hull identity in the afd1 mutant, and that the hull-like lodicules and the thickened hulls confined the stamens in the space bounded by the hulls and for better pollination. Additionally, 9% of afd1 florets generated awns at the top of the lemmas and the epidermal cells of awns had lots of trichomes, and no awns were formed in the florets of the wild type (Figures S3, S4A).These results suggested that the low setting percentage in the afd1 mutant was due to both inefficient pollination (i.e. the thicker hulls limited the pollination in the afd1 mutant) and defective pollen grains.eantime, the awn was observed at the top of the afd1 lemma primordium but no awn was found in the wild type (Figure 6D, H). These results suggested that AFD1 affected the enlargement of the hulls and restrained the formation of the awns at later stages, but seemed not to influence floral organ initiation.",

The first internode was notably shorter in the mutant at maturity, while other internodes showed no difference.

Additionally, 9% of afd1 florets formed awns with trichomes, unlike the wild type. The low setting percentage in the afd1 mutant was due to inefficient pollination and defective pollen grains.

        "question": "OsSPL14 is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1g), consistent with a role as a trans­cription factor. RNA in situ hybridization revealed that OsSPL14 was ­predominantly expressed in the shoot apex at both the vegetative (Fig. 2a) and re­productive (Fig. 2b) stages. It was also highly expressed in the promordia of primary and secondary branches (Fig. 2c)。Expression patterns of OsSPL14 and OsmiR156 in various rice organs revealed by real-time PCR and miRNA gel blot analyses showed that OsSPL14 was highly expressed in the culm and shoot apex, which is complementary with the expression pattern of OsmiR156 in vivo (Fig. 2e,f). Consistently, overexpression of OsmiR156 resulted in a substantial decrease in OsSPL14 transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 7a), whereas the interruption of OsmiR156 (overexpression of MIM156)20 led to a marked increase in OsSPL14 transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 7b).

        "question": "To determine whether OsSPL14 underlies the IPA1 QTL, we performed a confirmation test by generating transgenic plants expressing different levels of OsSPL14 in the Nipponbare and Ri22 lines, the japonica varieties suitable for gene transformation. We introduced the plasmid carrying OsSPL14 (designated gOsSPL14), which contained a 7.2-kb genomic DNA fragment, into Nipponbare (see Online Methods). The gOsSPL14 transgenic lines had reduced tillers, stronger culms and increased panicle branches and grain yield (Supplementary Fig. 4). In contrast, the OsSPL14 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants in the Ri22 background generated more tillers and showed a marked reduction in plant height, diameter of culms, panicle branches and grain number (Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, we concluded that OsSPL14 is the gene responsible for ideal plant architectur and grain number (Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, we concluded that OsSPL14 is the gene responsible for ideal plant architecture.",

        "question": "esulting knockout lines (KO-GL10) harbored a frameshift mutation that caused premature termination of translation (Fig. S4A and S4B). These KO-GL10 lines exhibited significantly decreased grain length, grain width, and 1000-grain weight compared to those of the HJX74 wild-type line (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E). In addition, heading date differed significantly between KO-GL10 and HJX74 (Fig. S4C), although we found no detectable differences in plant height, effective tiller numbers, or grain number (Fig. S4DeS4F). We also generated a genetic complementation construct for GL10 overexpression in the NIL-gl10 background via transformation with a p35S-GL10 vector (Fig. S5A and S5B). The GL10 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased grain length and grain weight compared to that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. 2B, 2F, 2G, 2H). Moreover, OE-GL10 grain phenotypes were distinct from that of KO-GL10 plants, with grain length and heading date positively correlating with GL10 expression level. Notably, the heading stage of OE-GL10 was earlier than that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. S5C). In addition, we found no significant differences between OE-GL10 and NIL-gl10 in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant (Fig. S5DeS5F). These results indicate that GL10 was a positive regulator of grain length, grain weight and heading date.In addition, the SEM assays showed that HJX74 plants exhibited greater longitudinal grain length than plants from either KO-GL10 line (Fig. S6A, S6C, S6D), while the grain length of the KO-GL10 plants was similar to that of NIL-gl10 plants. We also observed that the epidermal cell sizes in spikelet hulls of the OEGL10 plants were significantly greater than in those of NIL-gl10 plants (Fig. S6B, S6E, S6F).

        "question": "The mutant osfie1 produced smaller seeds and displayed reduced dormancy, indicating that OsFIE1 predominantly functions in late seed development. Ectopic expression of OsFIE1, but not OsFIE2, was deleterious to vegetative growth in a dose-dependent manner. The newly evolved N-terminal tail of OsFIE1 was probably not the cause of the adverse effects on vegetative growth. The CRISPR/Cas9-derived mutant osfie2 exhibited impaired cellularization of the endosperm, which suggested that OsFIE2 is indispensable for early seed development as a positive regulator of cellularization. Autonomous endosperm was observed in both OsFIE2+ and osfie1/OsFIE2+ but at a very low frequency. Although OsFIE1-PRC2 exhibited H3K27me3 methyltransferase ability in plants, OsFIE1-PRC2 is likely to be less important for development in rice than is OsFIE2-PRC2.The expression of OsFIE1 in the endosperm in independent transgenic lines was significantly increased, whereas the expression of OsFIE2 was not altered in the transgenic plants (Figure 2b). Unlike the Ubi::OsFIE1 plants, the GT1::OsFIE1 lines showed vegetative development similar to that of the WT (Figure 2c). However, all three independent GT1:: OsFIE1 transgenic lines analyzed produced seeds significantly smaller than the WT seeds (Figure 2a and Figure S6). The 1000-grain weight of GT1::OsFIE1 was reduced to 86–88% of the WT value (Figure S6d). The results unambiguously indicated that overexpression of OsFIE1 could directly affect seed development.The osfie1 mutant produced smaller seeds and showed increased frequency of pre-harvest sprouting relative to the WT (Figure 3), suggesting that OsFIE1 plays roles in late seed development (Figure S13).",
        "answer": "The mutant osfie1 produces smaller seeds and shows reduced dormancy, indicating OsFIE1's role in late seed development. Overexpression of OsFIE1 negatively impacts vegetative growth, but its N-terminal tail doesn't cause adverse effects. The mutant osfie2 shows impaired endosperm cellularization, suggesting OsFIE2's essential role in early seed development. Autonomous endosperm is rarely observed in both OsFIE2+ and osfie1/OsFIE2+. OsFIE1-PRC2 exhibits H3K27me3 methyltransferase ability but is less important for rice development than OsFIE2-PRC2. Overexpression of OsFIE1 in transgenic lines increases its expression in the endosperm but doesn't alter OsFIE2's expression. GT1::OsFIE1 lines show normal vegetative development but produce smaller seeds, reducing the 1000-grain weight to 86–88% of the wild type.

        "question": "Wax biosynthesis begins with de novo-synthesized C16 and C18 fatty acids within the leucoplasts. C16 and C18 fatty acids are then elongated to VLCFAs by the fatty acid elongase (FAE) complex, consisting of b-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), b-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, b-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydratase, and enoylCoA reductase, on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). VLCFA elongation involves a four-step reaction cycle: First, the condensation of C16 and C18 acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA is catalyzed by KCS, yielding b-ketoacylCoA; second, the reduction of b-ketoacyl-CoA is catalyzed by b-ketoacyl-CoA reductase; third, the resulting b-hydroxy acyl-CoA is dehydrated by b-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydratase; and fourth, the enoyl acylCoA is reduced by enoyl-CoA reductase. Each cycle results in an acyl-CoA with a two-carbon extension (Kunst and Samuels, 2009). The generated VLCFACoAs are then thiolysed to yield free fatty acids or are used further in an acyl reduction (alcoholforming) pathway, yielding primary alcohols, or a decarbonylation (alkane-forming) pathway, yielding aldehydes and alkanes (Kunst and Samuels, 2003; Samuels et al., 2008)",
        "answer": "Wax biosynthesis starts with the creation of C16 and C18 fatty acids in leucoplasts. These acids are extended to very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) by the fatty acid elongase (FAE) complex on the endoplasmic reticulum. The elongation process involves four steps: condensation, reduction, dehydration, and further reduction, each adding two carbons to the acyl-CoA. The resulting VLCFACoAs can be broken down to produce free fatty acids, or used in pathways to produce primary alcohols, aldehydes, and alkanes.",

OsDT11 was found to be constitutively expressed in almost all of the tissues and organs examined, including the leaf, root, culm, pistil, anther and endosperm tissues. Obviously, OsDT11 expression in the leaf and root tissues was lower than that in the other tissues (Fig. 3a). We also investigated the expression pattern of OsDT11 under osmotic and salt stress conditions. As shown in Fig. 3b, its expression was highly induced by PEG 8000 treatment after 6 h, after which it gradually returned to a normal level at 24 h. Moreover, its expression level was higher at 3 h than at 6 and 24 h in response to treatment with 100 mM NaCl (Fig. 3c), suggesting that OsDT11 was also up-regulated by salt stress.",

        "question": "Overall, the analysis of the OsDT11 sequence demonstrated that this protein belongs to the CRP family. Since OsDT11 is predicted to be a secreted protein, the subcellular localization of OsDT11 was determined by fusing the OsDT11 ORF to RFP in a p35S::RFP vector by in vivo protein targeting in NB epidermal cells by performing an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient assay. After incubation for 48 h, the RFP signals were mainly detected in the cell-wall of OsDT11-RFP transformed cells, while the control cells (transformed with the RFP construct) displayed ubiquitous RFP signals, demonstrating that OsDT11 is a secreted signal peptide (Fig. 2b–d). Moreover, when the infiltrated leaf sections were plasmolyzed, the OsDT11-RFP fusion proteins were located on the cell wall (Fig. S2).",

        "question": "hirteen OsDT11-overexpressing lines were obtained, and three of them (pU1301::OsDT11-1,3, and 4) were selected for determination of the transcript level. When the plants were 15 days old, both the overexpressing and wild-type lines were deprived of water for 17 days. After the treatment, most of the wild-type plants withered, while the overexpressing lines exhibited less wilting compared with the control plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). Water was then supplied for 7 days, resulting in the recovery of all of the transgenic lines but not the wild-type plants (Fig. 4a, panel RW). OsDT11 expression in the transgenic plants was significantly correlated with water loss (r = −0.855, Fig. 4b, c). To further confirm the function of OsDT11 in drought tolerance, the knockdown transgenic lines were also examined under drought stress conditions. The transgenic plants were found to be more sensitive to drought stress than the wildtype plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). After rewatering for 7 days, neither the transgenic nor the wild-type lines recovered (Fig. 4a, panel RW). The water loss of the wild-type plants was approximately 10 % lower than that of the suppressed plants. Additionally, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the OsDT11 expression level in the knockdown lines was associated with water loss (r = −0.767, Fig. 4b, c). These results indicate that the overexpression of OsDT11 improves the tolerance to drought stress in rice. To further evaluate the physiological mechanism by which OsDT11 enables the plant to retain water, the stomata and wax on the leaf surface of wild-type and transgenic plants were visualized by ESEM. It was found that the stomatal size was smaller on the leaf surface of wildtype plants under drought stress conditions, compared with the wild-type plants under normal condition (Fig. 5a, b). However, there was no obvious difference between the overexpressing lines and wild-type plants under normal conditions, and the overexpression lines after drought treatment (Fig. 5c, d). Similar results were observed for the calculated stomatal density. Only the drought-stressed wild-type plants presented as higher stomatal density on the leaves than the others three samples (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, there was no obvious difference between the wax distribution of the wild-type and transgenic lines under normal conditions, and a reduction in wax content was only observed for wild-type lines after drought treatment (Fig. S3). These results indicate that OsDT11 overexpression may improve water retention by modulating stomatal density.To test whether ABA biosynthesis was affected in the transgenic plants, the endogenous ABA levels in the overexpressing and wild-type lines were measured under normal conditions and were found to be 16.25 ng g−1FW on average in the wild-type seedlings, while they were increased to 61.56, 35.91, and 24.96 ng g−1FW in the three different pU1301::OsDT11 lines, respectively (Fig. 8). These findings suggested that the ABA concentration was highly increased in the overexpressing seedlings, demonstrating that ABA biosynthesis was affected in the OsDT11 transgenic plants.",
        "answer": "The study found that overexpressing the OsDT11 gene in rice plants improves their drought tolerance. Compared to wild-type plants, the OsDT11-overexpressing lines showed less wilting after 17 days without water and recovered after rewatering, while the wild-type did not. The overexpression of OsDT11 was significantly correlated with reduced water loss. Knockdown transgenic lines were more sensitive to drought and did not recover after rewatering. The study also found that OsDT11 overexpression may improve water retention by modulating stomatal density. Additionally, the endogenous ABA levels, which affect water retention, were found to be higher in the overexpressing lines, indicating that ABA biosynthesis was affected in the OsDT11 transgenic plants.",

The evaluation of BPH resistance in transgenic plants confirmed the crucial function of Bph32 in BPH resistance. Bph32 encodes a short consensus repeat (SCR) domain-containing protein that confers an antibiosis resistance to BPH and is localized in the plasma membrane of the cell.

Real-time (RT) PCR analysis showed that Bph32 was expressed in all investigated tissues at the flowering stage, and its expression level was highest in leaf sheaths followed by leaf blades, culms, panicles and roots (Fig. 3a), consistent with the preference of BPH to settle and probe in leaf sheaths at the flowering stage49. Bph32 expression was further analysed in more detail using transgenic plants carrying a Bph32 promoter-driven GUS reporter gene. GUS expression was observed in the root, leaf blade, leaf sheath, culm, glume, flower, immature seed and germinating seed (Fig. 3b), and GUS activity was strongly detected in parenchyma cells and the vascular bundle (Fig. 3b1,4 and 3b2,3).

Six independent transgenic events were detected using genomic southern blotting. Among them, N65-71-1-8 contains a single-copy of Bph32 and N65-2-5-2-6 contains a double-copy. Their T2:3 plants were used to measure the levels of resistance of Bph32. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, upon infestation with BPH at the seedling stage, all the wild-type control (Kasalath and TN1) and empty-vector transgenic plants died, whereas the transgenic rice plants expressing the Ptb33 Bph32 gene survived (Fig. 2a,b and c). When infected at the maturing stage, the wild-type plants exhibited leaf wilting, a decrease in seed and grain plumpness, and even death of the whole plant, whereas the Bph32 transgenic plants were all healthy (Fig. 2d). Plants have evolved three defence mechanisms for responding to insect attack: antixenosis repels or disturbs insect settling, thereby reducing colonization or oviposition; antibiosis reduces insect feeding, survival or growth rate; and tolerance helps a crop to maintain high quality and yield after insect infestation48. To explore how Bph32 is involved in plant resistance to BPH, we conducted assays to compare nymph survival and honeydew excretion between the resistant Bph32 transgenic and susceptible wild-type plants (Table S3 and Fig. 2e and f). In the nymph survival test, the number of nymphs steadily decreased on the transgenic plants but began to stabilize 8 days after infestation on the wild-type controls (Fig. 2e). Honeydew excretion in the honeydew area of the transgenic plants was significantly lower than that of the wild-type controls or TN1 plants. However, the difference in honeydew excretion between the transgenic plants and the Ptb33 plants was insignificant (Fig. 2f). These results demonstrate that BPH feeding was inhibited on the resistant Bph32 transgenic plants and suggest that Bph32 conferred an antibiosis resistance that reduced BPH feeding and survival.",
        "answer": "The LOC_Os06g03240 gene, also known as Bph32, was found to confer resistance to the Brown Planthopper (BPH) in rice plants. This was confirmed through experiments on the susceptible indica variety, Kasalath (Ka), which was transformed with the Bph32 gene. Transgenic rice plants expressing Bph32 survived BPH infestation at both seedling and maturing stages, while control and empty-vector transgenic plants did not. The Bph32 gene appears to confer an antibiosis resistance, reducing BPH feeding and survival, as evidenced by lower nymph survival and honeydew excretion in transgenic plants compared to wild-type controls.",

        "question": "To analyze the salt-tolerant phenotypes of SR86 and Nipponbare (Nip), SR86 and Nip rice were treated with different concentrations of salt. In the 150 mM NaCl treatment, SR86 plants showed a survival rate of 70%, while Nip showed no survival (Fig. 1A–D). To mine the salt tolerance-related genes in SR86, 30 extremely salt-tolerant and 30 extremely salt-sensitive plants were selected from the F(2) progeny of the SR86 × Nip cross, and mixed bulks were generated. BSA-seq analysis revealed salt tolerance related candidate region on chromosome 4, chromosome 8 and chromosome 12 (Fig. 1E). Based on the threshold line, chromosome 4 was judged to have the relevant to the target trait (Fig. 1E). Functional annotation analysis revealed that this region contained a putative salt stress-related gene, LOC_Os04g03320. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis suggested that the expression level of LOC_Os04g03320 was significantly higher in SR86 than that in Nip in the 150 mM NaCl treatment (Fig. 1F). Therefore, we selected LOC_Os04g03320 as the candidate salt tolerance-related gene. Because the protein encoded by this gene was a JRLs protein, we named this gene as OsJRL45.",

        "question": "The ability of seeds to germinate under high salinity conditions is an important indicator of salt tolerance [53]. Germination experiments were performed using the seeds of WT plants, Osjrl45 mutant lines (KO1 and KO2), and OsJRL45-OE lines (OE1 and OE2) under control (0 mM NaCl) and salt treatments (100 and 200 mM NaCl) (Fig. 4C–E). Under normal conditions, the WT, KO1, KO2, OE1, and OE2 genotypes showed no difference in the seed germination rate and seedling growth (Fig. 4C). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, compared with the WT, the shoot and root lengths of knockout mutants seedlings were significantly reduced, while those of overexpression lines seedlings were significantly increased (Fig. 4C-E). Under 200 mM NaCl stress, the KO1 and KO2 lines showed seed germination but almost no seedling growth (Fig. 4C-E).Next, we analyzed the salt tolerance of WT and all knockout and overexpressed transgenic rice at the seedling period. Under normal conditions, the WT, KO1, KO2, OE1, and OE2 genotypes showed no difference (Fig. 5A). Under salt stress, the knockout plants indicated severe wilting, while the overexpressed plants grew better than WT plants (Fig. 5A). The chlorophyll content, fresh weights and dry weights of KO1 and KO2 plants were significantly lower after treatment than before treatment, while the chlorophyll contents of OE1 and OE2 plants were lower and their fresh weights and dry weights were significantly higher (Fig. 5C-E). The survival rates (Fig. 5B), chlorophyll contents (Fig. 5C), fresh weights (Fig. 5D), and dry weights (Fig. 5E) of knockout plants seedlings were significantly lower than those of the WT plants, while those of overexpressed transgenic rice seedlings were higher under salinity stress treatments. Collectively, these results suggest that OsJRL45 positively regulates salt tolerance at the germination and seedling stages.To elucidate its biological function, the OsJRL45 gene isolated from SR86 was transformed into the salt-sensitive indica cultivar L6-23. The promoter of OsJRL45 was cloned into the pCAMBIA1300 vector, and the resultant construct was transformed into L6-23 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to create transgenic rice (named Lh). The L6-23 plants suggested severe wilting, while the Lh plants grew better than the L6-23 rice under salt stress (Fig. 7A). RT-qPCR results indicated that the expression level of OsJRL45 was significantly higher in Lh transgenic rice than in L6-23 plants (Fig. 7B). Compared with the L6-23 plants, the survival rate (Fig. 7C) and chlorophyll content (Fig. 7D) of Lh plants were significantly higher under salt stress conditions.",
        "answer": "Experiments on seed germination under high salinity conditions found that the OsJRL45 gene positively regulates salt tolerance in rice at the germination and seedling stages. Under normal conditions, there was no difference in germination rate and seedling growth between wild-type (WT) plants and Osjrl45 mutant and overexpression lines. However, under salt stress, knockout mutants showed reduced shoot and root lengths and severe wilting, while overexpression lines showed increased lengths and better growth. The gene was then isolated and transformed into a salt-sensitive rice cultivar, resulting in significantly higher survival rates and chlorophyll content under salt stress conditions.",

        "question": "Ghd8 is expressed at a low level in all organs at different developmental stages, like OsHAP3H (namely Ghd8 in this study), whose expression was too low to be detected by RT–PCR in the tissues investigated (Thirumurugan et al., 2008). However, three OsHAP3 genes were highly expressed in all tested organs at different developmental stages. One gene (Loc_OS02g49410) showed preferential expression in the panicle and endosperm (Supplemental Figure 1). These findings indicated that different members of the OsHAP3 family have different functions in the rice lifecycle. To check the spatio-temporal expression of Ghd8 under LD conditions, RNA in situ hybridization was performed with roots, young leaves, stems, and young panicles of NILHR5. Ghd8 was highly expressed in the phloem of leaves, the vascular system of the stem, and especially in cells of the inflorescence meristem. The inflorescence meristem formed bracts and inflorescence branches (Itoh et al., 2005), which probably determined panicle size (Supplemental Figure 2).",

        "question": "To test this prediction, we introduced both Ghd8 alleles of 93–11 (Ghd8 (93–11)) and Nipponbare (Ghd8(Nip)) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into NILZS, which has a small panicle, short stature, and early heading compared to NILHR5. The T1 families of the T0 transformants containing a single-copy of the Ghd8 (93–11) and (Ghd8 (Nip)) alleles were analyzed for their phenotypic effects under natural LD conditions (13–14-h day length). The positive T1 plants showed significantly more grains, delayed heading and taller culms compared to the transgenic negative plants (Figure 1). The negative Ghd8 transgenic plants (NILZS–) showed a performance similar to their recipient line NILZS in heading date, grain yield, grains per panicle, and plant height (Table 1). On average, a positive T1 plant (NIL93–11+/NILNip+) resulted in increases above 60% in grain yield per plant and grains per panicle compared to the recipient NILZS and the negative T1 plant (NILZS–) (Figure 1). The NILNip+ plant showed a performance similar to that of the NIL carrying the HR5 homozygotes (NILHR5) in grain yield, grains per panicle, and plant height; however, the transformants with the Ghd8 (93–11) allele were delayed in flowering by 9 d, thus indicating the strong effect of the 93–11 allele on heading date (Table 1). In summary, the complementary test confirmed that the candidate gene was in fact Ghd8.When compared to ZS97, ZS97Nip flowered earlier and later under SD and LD conditions, respectively (Table 2). That is to say, the Ghd8 allele of Nipponbare promoted flowering under SD conditions and inhibited flowering under LD conditions in ZS97. We also compared the diurnal expression of OsMADS51 (Kim et al., 2008) under SD conditions, that of OsMADS50 under LD conditions and that of OsGI, Hd1, Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 under both conditions between positive and negative transgenic plants (ZS97Nip+ and ZS97Nip–). There was no difference in diurnal expression for OsGI, OsMADS51, OsMADS50, and Hd1, but a distinct difference was observed for Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 between ZS97Nip+ and ZS97Nip– (Figure 3A and 3B). These results indicated that Ghd8 acts upstream of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1. ",

GUS staining of the transgenic plants indicated that TAC4 was expressed in almost all the organs, including root, culm, leaf sheath, tiller base and young panicle (Figure 3a–j). Consistent with the GUS staining data, a quantitative real-time PCR analysis also showed that TAC4 was ubiquitously expressed in various rice organs, with the most abundant expression occurring in the young panicle, lamina joint, leaf sheath pulvinus and internode (Figure 3k). TAC4 mRNA in situ hybridization showed that a high TAC4 transcript abundance could be detected in the axillary and shoot apical meristem at the tillering stage (Figure 3l–o). RNA-sequencing data showed TAC4 transcripts in both the lower and upper sides of tiller bases, and the expression levels were similar (Figure S5).

        "question": "The function of LOC_Os02g25230 was further confirmed by genetic transformation. All the transgenic plants overexpressing the full-length coding sequence of LOC_Os02g25230 (derived from IL55) in the tac4-mutant background displayed the small tiller angle phenotype, similar to IL55 (Figure 2b–e). Using RNA interference (RNAi), we generated LOC_Os02g25230 knockdown plants in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare background. The RNAi transgenic plants exhibited greater tiller angles compared with control plants, indicating that the decreased expression of LOC_Os02g25230 significantly increased tiller angle (Figure 2f–h). Therefore, we concluded that LOC_Os02g25230 corresponds to the TAC4 gene and that the expression level of TAC4 was negatively correlated with tiller angle.the introgression line IL55 harbouring the tac1 allele (Aida et al., 1997), which displays an extremely compact tiller angle in the indica rice variety IR24 background, was mutagenized with ethyl methane sulphonate to generate a mutant library for screening plants with large tiller angles. One such mutant, tac4, was identified. During both the vegetative and reproductive stages, tac4 always exhibited a greater tiller angle than IL55 (Figure 1a and b, and Figure S1), and at the heading stage, the tiller angle was ~13.2° in the tac4 mutant, while it was only ~5.2° in the IL55 (Figure 1c and d). The heights of tac4 plants were reduced ~20% compared with those of IL55 and mainly resulted from the shortened uppermost internode (Figure S2a–c). Observations of longitudinal sections of the uppermost internode revealed that cell lengths were significantly decreased in tac4, indicating that the decreased cell elongation could be the main cause of the reduced tac4 plant height (Figure S2d). We found that the panicle length was shorter, and the primary and secondary branches and the grain number per panicle were significantly reduced, compared with IL55 (Table S1). The grain length of tac4 was shorter than that of IL55, and the mean 1000-grain weight was less (Figure S3). These observations suggest that TAC4 is pleiotropic, regulating multiple important agronomic traits.",
        "answer": "The function of the gene LOC_Os02g25230, also known as TAC4, was confirmed through genetic transformation. When overexpressed in transgenic plants, it resulted in a small tiller angle phenotype, similar to IL55. Conversely, when its expression was decreased through RNA interference, the tiller angle increased. This indicates that TAC4 expression is negatively correlated with tiller angle. Additionally, the tac4 mutant exhibited a greater tiller angle, reduced plant height due to decreased cell elongation, and shorter panicle length, with fewer branches and grains per panicle compared to IL55.

Specifically, 3-bp and 11-bp deletions were detected at the target site of LOC_Os01g20110 in the two transgenic lines, respectively (Fig. 6d). These deletions resulted in frameshift mutations. Thus, we verified that LOC_Os01g20110 was the candidate OsAL50 gene, with mutations in the associated promoter region potentially contributing to the observed albino phenotype in osal50 mutant plants.All\nof these genes were significantly down-regulated in osal50mutant leaves compared with wild-type leaves at the four-leaf stage (Fig. 8a), with consistent expression patterns oftranscriptional suppression in young panicles, includingglumes and branches, of osal50 at the heading stage, except for the chloroplast development-related FtsZ, OsRPOB, and V3 genes (Fig. 8c, d).

        "question": "it was used for gen-\nerating T-DNA insertion knockout (ossiz2 in Dongjin [DJ] background) and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated\nknockdown (Ri1-3 in Nipponbare [NB] background) mutants (Supplemental Fig. S1). The insertion of the T-DNA\nwas downstream of the OsSIZ2 translational start site and in the exon 5 (Supplemental Fig. S1a). Two-round PCR\nwas employed for screening randomly selected 11 putative T-DNA insertion mutants for identifying homozygous\nossiz2 knockout mutants by using (i) T-DNA right border-specific primer P and OsSIZ2-specific primer R1 and(ii) OsSIZ2-specific primers (F1 and R1) flanking the T-DNA insertion site (Supplemental Fig. S1a,b). The anal-ysis revealed that ~55% of them (lines 3 to 8 marked with red boxes) are homozygous and are hereafter referred to as ossiz2 (Supplemental Fig. S1b). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out by using F2 and R2 primers for validating the lack of OsSIZ2 transcripts in ossiz2 mutants (lines 3, 5, 7 and 8; Supplemental Fig. S1c). Further,qRT-PCR was employed by using OsSIZ2-specific primers for determining the relative expression levels of OsSIZ2\nin wild-types (NB and DJ) and the mutants (Ri1-3 and ossiz2) (Supplemental Fig. S1d). The relative expression levels of OsSIZ2 were significantly reduced (~35–58%) in Ri1-3 and undetected in ossiz2 compared with their cor-responding wild-type. The results confirmed that Ri1-3 and ossiz2 are knockdown and knockout mutants, respec-tively of OsSIZ2. Southern blot analysis confirmed a single T-DNA insertion in ossiz2 (Supplemental Fig. S1e).The present study thus suggested a pivotal role of OsSIZ2 in exerting positive regulatory influences on the developmental responses of different morphometric traits during vegetative and reproductive growth phases. Comparative analyses of these traits in ossiz2 with ossiz1 also revealed some degree of functional redundancy between OsSIZ2 and OsSIZ1.Therefore, Pi concentration in the xylem sap was assayed in\nthe culms of wild-types (NB and DJ) and the mutants (Ri1-3 and ossiz2) grown in a pot soil up to the grain-fillingstage (Fig. 5). Pi concentration in the xylem sap  was significantly higher in Ri1-3 (~21–83%) and ossiz2 (~35%)compared with their corresponding wild-type.. Although a similar trend of significantly elevated total P concentration was also observed in these tissues of ossiz1 and ossiz2 compared with DJ, the effect was more pronounced in ossiz1 than ossiz2.the relative expression analysis of Ri1-3 and ossiz2 provided evidence towards the differential regulatory influence of OsSIZ2 on a subset of molecular entities that governs Pi homeostasis in rice.The result provided some evidences towards the regulatory influence of OsSIZ1 on OsSIZ2 in roots of the seedlings grown under different Pi regime.",

The analysis revealed that around 55% of the mutants were homozygous and were referred to as ossiz2.

        "question": "The agronomic traits of the OE and T-DNA insertion lines were evaluated (Fig. 2E, F). Yield-related traits in Hwaseong, CR4379, and the transgenic lines were compared at maturity (Supplementary Table S4). The difference in DTH, PH, and SPP between all three OE lines and Hwaseong was significant (Fig. 2F). All OE lines had larger grains than Hwaseong, mainly due to increased GL and GW (Fig. 2E, F). The four T-DNA insertion lines showed variation in all traits measured. Insertion line #8 flowered earlier, and showed reduced PH and grain size compared with wild-type Dongjin, and line #5 was also shorter with fewer SPP and had smaller grains than Dongjin (Fig. 2F). Line #1 showed significant differences from Dongjin in PH, grain weight, and grain shape traits, and line #9 displayed a significant difference only for PH. We also evaluated MS5 T-DNA insertion mutants derived from the cultivar Hwayeong. No consistent differences in PH and DTH were observed between T-DNA insertion mutants and wild-type Hwayeong. However, the MS5 mutants all exhibited high spikelet sterility, which was consistent with a role of MS5 in grain fertility (Supplementary Table S5). These results indicate that APX9 is responsible for the QTL cluster that affects DTH, PH, SPP, GL, and GW. The performance of OE and T-DNA insertion lines suggests that the 3 bp InDel in APX9 is associated with the QTL cluster.

Among them, 8 Ehd1-OX and 11 Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines at T1 generation were flowering earlier than wild type under NDs (two representative lines of each genotype were shown in Fig. 4, A and B), demonstrating that overexpression of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the later flowering phenotype of ABF1V.To measure and compare the flowering times between Ehd1OXand Ehd1-OX/ABF1V, two independent lines of each genotype expressing equal levels of Ehd1-Flag protein were selected for the investigation (Fig. 4C). The results showed that Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines were flowering about 4 d later than Ehd1-OX lines grown in NDs. This slight flowering difference might be due to the dosage effect of Ehd1 mRNA, because the transcription of endogenous Ehd1 was suppressed in Ehd1-OX/ABF1V but not in Ehd1-OX. Alternatively, ABF1V may not repress flowering in a manner entirely dependent on the Ehd1 pathway. Furthermore, we tested if ABF1E accelerates flowering through enhancing Ehd1 expression. In total, 18 and 15 Ehd1-RNAi transgenic lines in wild-type background (Ehd1R)and ABF1E-1 background (Ehd1RNAi/ABF1E) were generated, respectively. Among them, 15 Ehd1R and 12 Ehd1R/ABF1E lines at T1 generation were similarly flowering later than wild type under NDs (two representative lines of each genotype were shown in Supplemental Fig. S4), demonstrating that knockdown of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the early flowering phenotype of ABF1E. Taken together, our molecular and genetic results support the hypothesis that OsABF1 regulates flowering time through the Ehd1mediated flowering pathway.demonstrating that OsABF1-RNAi attenuates drought delay of flowering. Together, these results suggested that OsABF1 and OsbZIP40 function redundantly in mediating drought inhibition of flowering through the Ehd1 pathway.",
        "answer": "The study tested the role of ABF1V in suppressing flowering through downregulation of Ehd1 expression. Transgenic lines were created in both wild-type and ABF1V-1 backgrounds, with results showing that overexpression of Ehd1 can suppress the later flowering phenotype of ABF1V. However, Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines flowered about 4 days later than Ehd1-OX lines, suggesting that ABF1V may not entirely repress flowering through the Ehd1 pathway. The study also tested if ABF1E accelerates flowering through enhancing Ehd1 expression. Transgenic lines were created in both wild-type and ABF1E-1 backgrounds, with results showing that knockdown of Ehd1 can suppress the early flowering phenotype of ABF1E.

        "question": "To analyze the genetic basis for the late flowering time of wild rice, we constructed an F2 population derived from crosses between YIL79 and Teqing. All of the F1 progeny exhibited late flowering (145 ± 2.8 d) under long-day conditions, which was similar to that of the introgression line YIL79. In one F2 population with 1000 plants, the ratio of plants exhibiting late flowering (759) to plants exhibiting normal flowering (241) was 3:1.

To elaborate the role of LHD1in the rice flowering pathway, we examined the expression levels of LHD1 and other heading date genes (OsGI, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, Hd1, Ehd1, Hd3a, RFT1) in both YIL79 and Teqing under long-day and short-day conditions, respectively. We found that no difference in the LHD1 expression levels could be detected between YIL79 and Teqing under both long-day and short-day conditions, respectively, suggesting that late flowering did not result from the LHD1 transcript. For OsGI, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, Hd1, no difference could be detected under long-day and short-day conditions between YIL79 and Teqing.

        "question": "To examine whether the expression of DTH8 is influenced by Hd1 and Ghd7, DTH8 expression was examined in Hd1 and Ghd7 near-isogenic lines (NILs) grown for 40 d under LD conditions. As shown in Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure S7A, the expression levels of DTH8 and Ghd7, compared with those in Nipponbare, were not changed in NIL (hd1) grown under LD conditions. However, Ehd1 and Hd3a were suppressed by Hd1 in Nipponbare. Similarly, no changes were found in the levels of DTH8 and Hd1 mRNA in the Ghd7 NILs under LD conditions. But the expressions of Ehd1 and Hd3a were also suppressed by Ghd7 (Fig. 6B; Supplemental Fig. S7B). These results indicate that DTH8 suppresses rice flowering by down-regulating the expression of Ehd1 and Hd3a, and that the expression of DTH8, Hd1,or Ghd7 is independent of each other under LD conditions.. Meanwhile, the differences between DTH8 and Ghd7 were also very obvious. Tiller number in Ghd7 NILs with functional or nonfunctional alleles differed from each other (Xue et al., 2008); those between Asominori and CSSL61 are the same (Fig. 1; Supplemental Tables S2 and S3). Ghd7 regulates the height through total cell number in the y axes of internodes and it also influences culm thickness, whereas DTH8 regulates height by altering cell elongation in the internodes, but keeps culm thickness stable (Fig. 7).",

        "question": "Two independent floral regulators, Hd1 and Ehd1,control flowering through regulating Hd3a and RFT1 in rice (Izawa 2007; Tsuji et al. 2011). To investigate whether the alteration of expression patterns of the two ‘florigen’ genes by EF8 is mediated by Hd1, Ehd1 or other regulators of Hd1 and Ehd1, such as OsMADS51, OsMADS50 and OsGI (Hayama et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2010), we examined their mRNA levels between wild type and the ef8 mutant under LDs and SDs. Under LDs, to our surprise, no significant differences in the expression of any of these genes were detected between ef8 mutant and wild type (Fig. 5a). Under SDs, the expression pattern of Ehd1 was slightly changed in ef8 mutant compared to wild type, but the expression patterns of other genes were not changed (Fig. 5b). Together, these results indicated that EF8 delayed flowering through altering the rhythmic expression patterns of the ‘florigen’ genes Hd3a and RFT1 independently of Hd1 and Ehd1 under LDs.\nThe ef8 mutant displayed a slightly darker green leaf phenotype and more chlorophyll content compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. S1), which suggested that EF8 may have effect on chlorophyll biogenesis. To test this, we extracted total RNAs from 30-dayold leaves of wild-type and ef8 mutant seedlings under both LDs and SDs, and performed QRT-PCR to examine the expression of genes encoding the enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in rice. Most of these genes were up-regulated to different degrees except chlorophyll synthetase (CHLG)in ef8 mutant compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 6a). For example, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM) and NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A (PORA) were up-regulated more than threefold, and Mg chelatase H subunit (CHLH) and divinyl reductase (DVR) about twofold. However, there were no significant differences in the transcription level of these genes under SDs (Fig. 6b). This result indicated that the higher chlorophyll content was due to higher expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes in the ef8 mutant compared to wild type and EF8 negatively regulated chlorophyll biogenesis under LDs.",
        "answer": "The study investigates the role of EF8 in the regulation of flowering and chlorophyll biogenesis in rice. It was found that EF8 alters the rhythmic expression patterns of the 'florigen' genes Hd3a and RFT1, independently of the floral regulators Hd1 and Ehd1 under long-day conditions (LDs). The ef8 mutant also showed a darker green leaf phenotype and higher chlorophyll content compared to wild type under LDs, due to the up-regulation of most chlorophyll biosynthetic genes. This suggests that EF8 negatively regulates chlorophyll biogenesis under LDs.",

        "question": "Compared with the wild type, the grain length of wbg1 was unchanged, but grain width and thickness were significantly decreased (Figure 1B). The filling rate of wbg1 grains across the whole filling period was lower than that in the wild type, and the thousand-grain weight of wbg1 mature seeds was also decreased (Figures 1C, D). Starch measurement showed that the total starch and amylose contents were reduced in the wbg1 mutant (Figures 1E, F). Although wbg1 had decreased grain quality and weight, there was no significant difference in plant height when compared with the wild type (Figures 1G, H). Together, these results indicated that the mutation in wbg1 led to a decrease in grain filling rate and a white belly phenotype in mature grains.",

        "question": "We isolated a rice bglu6 mutant (04Z11IG62) with a T-DNA insertion in the sixth intron of the gene (Fig. 1a). Molecular analysis revealed that this T-DNA insertion resulted in no detectable expression ofBGLU6in leaves and roots (Fig. S1a,b). Phenotypic analysis showed that disruption of BGLU6 led to a 46.2% and 66.9% decrease in seedling plant height compared to the WT, at 7 and 14 d post-transplantation, respectively (Figs 1b, S1c,d). The dwarf phenotype was present throughout the entire growth and development stages (Figs 1b, S1c,d). By contrast, no difference was seen in root length of bglu6compared to the WT root length (data not shown). To confirm the role ofBGLU6on plant height, we generated bglu6 RE and OE transgenic rice lines by introducing an Ubiquitin-driven construct harboring BGLU6 (Fig. S2a). The plant height ofBGLU6RE lines were 93.2% that of the WT, indicating a nearly complete restoration of height through expression of BGLU6 in the mutant. BGLU6OE lines had a plant height of 120.5% of the WT (Fig. S2b,c). Likewise, no obvious difference was seen in root length and weight between these genotypes (data not shown). b-glucosidases have been reported to hydrolyze inactive ABAGE, and result in an increase in the endogenous ABA concentration. To investigate if the dwarfism is related to cellular ABA concentration, we examined the endogenous ABA content in leaves of the WT and the bglu6mutant at the seedling stage. ABA content in bglu6was 68.2% that of the WT (Fig. 1c). We also examined leafGA3 content and no difference was seen between the WT and the bglu6mutant (Fig. 1c), suggesting the enzyme is specific for hydrolysis of ABA-GE. Furthermore, spraying 10 lMABA onto bglu6leaves partly restored the plant height ofbglu6(Fig. 1d). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption of BGLU6 affects ABA concentration in leaves, resulting in a dwarfism in the mutant.\nUnder normal conditions, the hydrolysis activity ofABA-GE in the OE-5 line was 22.6% higher than that of the WT (Fig. 2c). After 2 d of drought stress, the hydrolysis activity in the WT and the OE-5 line was increased to 121% and 105% of activity before the treatment (Fig. 2c). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that BGLU6 hydrolyzes ABA-GE to ABA in vitro, and that this activity can be enhanced by drought stress.\nOf the downregulated DEGs, seven were related to stress. Of these, heat shock protein 81-2 (OS09G0482100), SPX domaincontaining protein (OS02G0202200) and embryonic abundant protein (OS05G0349800) were downregulated the most (Table S4). Four DEGs that participate in photosynthesis were identified, with ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain (OS01G0791033), ATP synthase subunit beta, chloroplastic (OS10G0355800) downregulated the most (Table S3). Besides these, we also found that positive regulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis process (GO0010116) was significantly enriched in the DEGs. The expression patterns of these DEGs were confirmed by q-RT-PCR analysis (Fig. S5). Taken together, the above results suggest that disruption of BGLU6 affects chloroplastic oxidative stress and lowers the photosynthesis efficiency, even under normal condition.\nBecause disruption of BGLU6 resulted in a decrease in endogenous ABA concentrations in leaves, and BGLU6 was localized to the chloroplast, we examined the stomatal characteristics of WT, bglu6, RE and OE lines in leaves. Under normal conditions, bglu6had significantly increased stomatal density, at 157.5% that of the WT. The increased stomatal density could be restored by expressing BGLU6 in the mutant, whereas in the OE line the density was not significantly different from that of the WT (Fig. 6a,c). After drought stress, stomatal density was slightly higher in these genotypes compared to that before treatment, except in the OE line, which had equivalent stomatal densities to those before stress (Fig. 6a,c). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption ofBGLU6affects stomatal density in leaves.",
        "answer": "A study isolated a rice bglu6 mutant with a T-DNA insertion that resulted in no detectable expression of BGLU6 in leaves and roots. This mutation led to a significant decrease in seedling plant height, but had no effect on root length. The researchers generated transgenic rice lines to confirm BGLU6's role in plant height, and found that reintroducing BGLU6 nearly restored the mutant's height. The study also found that the mutation affected the ABA concentration in leaves, resulting in dwarfism. Under drought stress, BGLU6 hydrolysis activity increased. The mutation also affected chloroplastic oxidative stress and photosynthesis efficiency. Additionally, the mutation resulted in increased stomatal density in leaves, which could be restored by expressing BGLU6 in the mutant.",

        "question": "knockout lines (KO-GL10) harbored a frameshift mutation that caused premature termination of translation (Fig. S4A and S4B). These KO-GL10 lines exhibited significantly decreased grain length, grain width, and 1000-grain weight compared to those of the HJX74 wild-type line (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E). In addition, heading date differed significantly between KO-GL10 and HJX74 (Fig. S4C), although we found no detectable differences in plant height, effective tiller numbers, or grain number (Fig. S4DeS4F). We also generated a genetic complementation construct for GL10 overexpression in the NIL-gl10 background via transformation with a p35S-GL10 vector (Fig. S5A and S5B). The GL10 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased grain length and grain weight compared to that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. 2B, 2F, 2G, 2H). Moreover, OE-GL10 grain phenotypes were distinct from that of KO-GL10 plants, with grain length and heading date positively correlating with GL10 expression level. Notably, the heading stage of OE-GL10 was earlier than that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. S5C). In addition, we found no significant differences between OE-GL10 and NIL-gl10 in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant (Fig. S5DeS5F). These results indicate that GL10 was a positive regulator of grain length, grain weight and heading date.\noverexpression of GL10 results in increased grain length and weight and earlier heading date. GL10 regulates grain length by promoting greater longitudinal cell growth in the grain glume. Additionally, GL10 participates in the regulation of gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathway genes in young panicle tissues. Analysis of GL10 haplotypes shows obvious divergence between the japonica and indica lineages.",

All ‘glutathione metabolism’ DEGs encode glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and their up-regulation is related to an increased antioxidant capacity. Increased antioxidant capacity and DNA repair mechanisms at 24 HAI in response to PBZ might be part of a tolerance mechanism to cope with the germination delay, which is in line with a recent study that proposed a link between DNA repair and antioxidant activity in Medicago truncatula seed germination and seedling establishment.",

        "question": "There are multiple tryptophan-dependent IAA biosynthesis pathways in plants. The tryptophan aminotransferases TAR1 and TAR2 convert trp to indole-3-pyruvate (IPA), which is converted to indole acetic acid (IAA) by the YUCCA flavin monooxygenase. Further, superroot2 (SUR2) encodes the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP83B1, involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis and auxin homeostasis. We found two PBZ-up SUR2 at 12 HAI and one PBZ-down TAR2 at 24 HAI, indicating that GA promotes IAA production at these time points.",

SNP analysis of the Glyma.19G176300 in Suinong 14 and Zyd 00,006 revealed 5 SNPs in the promoter region and 2 SNPs in exons. Because these two base mutations did not alter the amino acid composition of the protein, the SNPs in the promoter may account for the differing expression patterns of Glyma.19G176300 in response to NopC. Thus, we named Glyma.19G176300 NopC Related Protein (GmCRP), which may be a candidate gene related to NopC after infection with the wild strain HH103.",

        "question": "By comparing the nucleotide differences of these genes between seed-flooding tolerant and sensitive lines, Glyma.13g248000 revealed one base mutation (T–A) at 145bp position in two seed-flooding tolerant lines L422 and L488, and this nonsynonymous mutation resulted in the single amino acid change (Cys-Ser) in protein . However, no base mutations/polymorphisms were observed in the other three candidate genes between tolerant and sensitive lines. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the 2 kb promoter region upstream of these four genes was performed. However, no nucleotide mutation was observed among these six tolerant and sensitive genotypes. Although no base mutation of Glyma.13g248000 was identified at 145 bp position in the seed-flooding tolerant line (L018), but the confirmation of this mutation in the remaining two seed-flooding tolerant line L422 and L488 suggested that Glyma.13g248000 was the most possible candidate gene associated with seed-flooding tolerance identified in this study, and this gene was designated as GmSFT.",

We used the elbow method, which enables the determination of the number of clusters by the curve’s elbow . Using the elbow approach, we detected three clusters/groups (i.e., K = 3), with groups I, II, and III containing 92, 105, and 160 landraces, respectively, all three of which were found to have varying degrees of admixture.",

        "question": "Specifically, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides directly participate in nucleic acid synthesis, which provides the ultimate energy source for the synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, peptides and secondary metabolites [55]. The de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway (orotate pathway) is defined as the formation of uridine monophosphate (UMP)from carbamoyl phosphate (CP), orotate, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), and a few other phosphate metabolites [56]. Our metabolomics profiling result indicates that the major building blocks, which are pyrimidine bases such as thymine, cytosine and uracil, are reduced significantly upon heat stress, which affects overall pyrimidine biosynthesis and nucleic acid biosynthesis .",

        "question": "Energy metabolism is substantially higher in young leaves than that in mature leaves. Indeed, young leaves are actively growing and require a substantial and sustained amount of energy to support their metabolism. As a result, they tend to have higher rates of photosynthesis and respiration than mature leaves. (26,27) A previous study showed that monosaccharides are biosynthesized through photosynthesis in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) leaves at an early stage while sucrose biosynthesis takes place in mature leaves. (20) In agreement, we detected many monosaccharides (xylose, galactose, mannose, glucose, and fructose) that are biosynthesized through photosynthesis and respiration during the V stages of soybean leaf development. Also during the V stages, energy metabolism was active, leading to an accumulation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (fumaric and malic acid).",
        "answer": "Energy metabolism is higher in young leaves compared to mature leaves due to their active growth, requiring more energy for photosynthesis and respiration. Young leaves primarily biosynthesize monosaccharides, while mature leaves focus on sucrose biosynthesis. In soybean leaf development, during the V stages, active energy metabolism results in the accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates like fumaric and malic acid.",

We performed multivariate analysis to identify the compounds that separated the samples based on growth stage and cultivar. PCA results revealed that the growth stage strongly influenced the clustering of samples and the PC1 loading plot indicated active carbon-related energy metabolism during the V stages. PLS-DA results unveiled significant alterations in the metabolic networks up to R5, indicating tight coordination between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Additionally, we observed dramatic changes in the contents of policosilanes, which are major components of the waxy leaf surface. In R6–R8, certain amino acids accumulated, indicating energy redistribution to the seed.",

        "question": "In similar conditions in other studies, glyphosate reduced root growth (length and weight) of susceptible soybean [21]. Consistent with the cited reports, glyphosate also reduced the root length of susceptible soybean seedlings . In contrast, glyphosate did not affect the root growth of GR soybeans—an expected result because this cultivar tolerates the herbicide. However, since glyphosate residues and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were found in GR soybean seeds in field’s conditions [22], growth and yield cannot be assumed to be unchanged. Glyphosate reduced the root growth of GR soybeans in greenhouse studies [23], but did not affect soybean growth in field experiments [24]. At least for the short-term experimental conditions reported in this work, the root length of GR soybeans was unaffected by glyphosate treatment.",

        "question": "The cultivar Jiaoda 133 is a vegetable soybean, and Williams 82 is a grain soybean; there are several seed phenotypic differences between them. The Jiaoda 133 pods harvested at the R6 stage (stage 6)  and boiled in water for 7 min, tasted sweet, soft and fragrant, whereas those of Williams 82 were hard and neither sweet nor fragrant. For vegetable soybean, the sweet taste is a key trait. To check out which sugar contributed to the sweet taste, we measured the content of four sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose) in fresh seeds at the stage R6. The sucrose content was significantly higher in Jiaoda 133 (2.39 g/100 g) than Williams 82 (1.52 g/100 g). The contents of fructose and glucose were low, with no significant differences between Jiaoda 133 and Williams 82. No maltose was detected . These results suggested that the sweet taste was determined mainly by sucrose content. The pods and fresh grains of Jiaoda 133 were much larger than those of Williams 82 at various developmental stages . At maturity, the 100-grain weight of Jiaoda 133 was 31.38 g and that of Williams 82 was 17.87 g (that 1.75-fold difference was significant) .",

        "question": "The sweeter taste is one of the major differences between grain and vegetable soybeans, which is determined by the higher sucrose content in vegetable soybean. Therefore, we focused on the expressions of genes related to sucrose metabolism and transport. Genes for sweet and waxy corn had been studied, and eight genes of maize endosperm mutant have been used for commercial breeding, including shrunken2 (sh2), brittle1 (bt1), brittle2 (bt2), sugary1 (su1), sugary enhancer1 (se1), amylose extender1 (ae1), dull endosperm1 (du1), and waxy1 (wx1) (Yang and Wang, 2005). The expression of most genes homologous to sh2, bt1 and su1 was higher in Williams 82 than Jiaoda 133 , which would contribute to accumulation of sucrose in Jiaoda 133. In contrast, the expression of genes homologous to bt2, se1, ae1, and du1 was lower in Williams 82 than Jiaoda 133 , which could increase the amylopectin content and contribute to waxy taste in Jiaoda 133. The expression patterns of two genes homologous to wx1 were opposite in the two genotypes , potentially leading to no difference in amylose",

        "question": "The 66 GmMIP sequences were also analyzed for distribution of introns and exons; the results are shown in Fig. 2 . The number of introns ranged from zero (in GmSIP1;5 and GmSIP1;6) to 5 (in GmNIP1;4 and GmNIP4;1). The division into five subfamilies based on comparison of the deduced protein sequences (see above) was mirrored in the intron-exon structures. All GmPIPs included three introns except GmPIP2;13 which contained four introns (intron # 1 is additional intron). For the GmTIPs, two introns were usual, but three genes: GmTIP1;7, GmTIP1;8 and GmTIP1;9 contained only one intron while one gene GmTIP5;1 contained three introns. GmNIPs contained variable introns with the majority characterized by 4 introns. GmNIP5;1 lacked one intron (intron # 2), GmNIP6;2 lacked two introns (intron # 2 and 3) while GmNIP1;4 and GmNIP4;1 each had five introns. GmSIPs contained two introns except GmSIP1;5 and GmSIP1;6 which included no intron. GmXIPs have a single intron.

        "question": "In this study, GmMTP8.1, a member of group 8 within the Mn-CDF cluster , displayed highest similarity with ShMTP8 in S. hamata that has been well-characterized for its involvement in Mn detoxification by the sequestration of Mn into vacuoles, was further selected to dissect its function in Mn detoxification. The GmMTP8.1 protein includes 294 amino acid residues (33.1 kDa) and possesses common features of Mn-CDF transporters, such as four putative TMDs, cation efflux, and ZT dimer domains . The consensus sequence DxxxD (x = any amino acid) localizes to the first TMD and the cytosolic loop of GmMTP8.1 . In addition, based on amino acid sequence comparisons, GmMTP8.1 shares a high degree of homology identity (90.8%) with ShMTP8 in S. hamata, and shares 83.3% identity with HvMTP8.1 in barley, 83% identity with OsMTP8.1 in rice, 83% identity with CsMTP8 in cucumber, and 81% identity with AtMTP8 in Arabidopsis, which were the representative MTP8-like proteins included in group 8 .

        "question": "Soybean seed protein quality is largely determined by its protein composition. This is especially true in the case of β-subunit of β-conglycinin, a protein that is totally devoid of methionine, an essential amino acid [25]. Since rj1 accumulated very little β-subunit of β-conglycinin, the relative levels of essential amino acids were examined in the total seed protein of Rj1 and rj1 soybeans. Table 1 shows the amino acid composition of Rj1 and rj1 soybean. It is evident that rj1 soybeans, in spite of accumulating lower amounts of β-subunit of β-conglycinin, contained relatively lower amounts of methionine (Table 1). Interestingly, the relative amount of cysteine is higher in rj1 soybeans and its abundance was reduced in the presence of nitrogen, indicating nitrogen may influence the accumulation of proteins that are rich in cysteine",
        "answer": "Soybean seed protein quality is influenced by its protein composition, particularly the β-subunit of β-conglycinin, which lacks methionine. rj1 soybeans accumulate less of this subunit and have lower methionine levels compared to Rj1 soybeans.

To corroborate these interactions in planta, native Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD proteins were transiently co-expressed with Gβ and Gγ proteins in tobacco leaves. We used two soybean Gβ proteins (Gβ2 and Gβ3), which belong to two different subgroups, and three different Gγ proteins (Gγ1, Gγ5 and Gγ9), representing each of the Gγ subgroups (Roy Choudhury et al., 2011), to test the tripartite interaction of Gβγ with Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD. In these assays, Gα1quadD also did not show any interaction, whereas the native Gα1 as well as Gα1quadA exhibited strong interactions with all tested combinations of Gβγ proteins . These data imply that the inability of the phosphorylated Gα proteins to interact with Gβγ, thereby making them constitutively available, is most likely to be the critical regulatory aspect of G-protein signaling during nodulation.",
        "answer": "The study tested interactions between native and variant Gα1 proteins and Gβ using a split-ubiquitin system. Native Gβ proteins interacted with native Gα1 and phospho-deficient Gα1 (Gα1quadA), but not with phosphorylated Gα1 (Gα1quadD). In tobacco leaves, native Gα1 and Gα1quadA showed strong interactions with various Gβγ combinations, while Gα1quadD did not. This suggests that phosphorylated Gα proteins' inability to interact with Gβγ is crucial for regulating G-protein signaling during nodulation.",

        "question": "For self-pollinating crops, conventional hybrid breeding methods can effectively achieve short-term goals. However, for increasingly diverse and high-standard breeding objectives, conventional hybrid breeding falls short. This is due to limitations such as survival rates, high workload, and time consumption, as well as a limited number of parent plants that can be included, leading to a narrow genetic base. Even when using the relatively high-success-rate technique of whole male sterility hybridization, it may not reach a 70% success rate if the technique is not well-executed.",

As shown in Fig. 8a, there were no significantly up-regulated genes observed in the ET biosynthetic process (GO:0009693) with HCN treatment. In contrast, the gene expressions of 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (e.g., ACS7) and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (e.g., ACO1) were downregulated by HCN treatment, especially for the transcript of ACO1, a key gene for ET synthesis, which was downregulated more than 3.5-fold when compared to the CK.",

An analysis of DEGs from CK vs HCN showed no significantly up-regulated genes in the ET biosynthetic process with HCN treatment.

        "question": "In addition, we examined whether CRY1 and TCP2 could form a complex in Arabidopsis. Transgenic plants overexpressing Myc-TCP2 were exposed to blue light or kept in darkness and then subjected to co-immunoprecipitation assays using anti-CRY1 and anti-MYC antibodies (Fig. 1F). The results of this experiment demonstrated that TCP2 formed a complex with CRY1 in Arabidopsis cells; however, no obvious blue light specificity was detected in this assay. Taken together, the results suggest that TCP2 physically interacts with CRY1 in yeast and plant cells.",

        "question": "TCP2 protein is stabilized by light but is labile in darkness; however, the relevant control mechanisms remain unknown. Given that ubiquitin/26S proteasome-dependent proteolysis is a common mechanism in the degradation of protein during light signal transduction (Lau and Deng, 2012), the TCP2 protein expression level was examined in the presence or absence of the 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in TCP2/WT lines. Tissue samples were harvested and incubated in either the presence or the absence of MG132 in darkness for 17h and analyzed by immunoblotting. As expected, in the absence of MG132, TCP2 protein levels decreased markedly, but, when MG132 was present, TCP2 levels only decreased slightly (Fig. 2F, G), suggesting that the decrease of the TCP2 protein expression level in the absence of blue light is due to proteolysis of TCP2 by the 26S proteasome.",
        "answer": "The TCP2 protein is stabilized by light but degrades in darkness, with its control mechanisms not fully understood. The study examined TCP2 levels in the presence or absence of the 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in darkness. Results showed that without MG132, TCP2 levels decreased significantly, while with MG132, the decrease was minimal. This suggests that TCP2 degradation in the absence of light is due to proteolysis by the 26S proteasome.",

A similar but more pronounced difference occurred in Myc-TCP2/cry1 and cry1, and this difference was maintained at fluence rates up to 60 μmol m–2 s–1 (Fig. 3E).

        "question": "Interestingly, knat6-1 reduced the inflorescence size in the clv3-1 background by 65%, as seen in the clv3-1 knat6-1 double mutant (Fig. 3g, j, and k). The knat6-1 was statistically similar to stm-1 knat6-1 inflorescence area (Fig. 3k). However, absence of both STM and KNAT-6 in the stm-1 clv3-1 knat6-1 triple mutant resulted in a 52% reduction in the inflorescence area as compared to clv3-1 plants (Fig. 3h, j, and k). Thus, stm and knat6 mutations have an additive effect in regulating clv3 inflorescence size. This suggests that CLV3 is epistatic to both STM and KNAT6 during inflorescence meristem development.",

        "question": "However, during the reproductive phase, the flowering time of DREB2C-overexpressors was delayed relative to that of the WT (Fig. 1), and silique development and seed production were severely decreased (Fig. 4a). Some siliques of DREB2C-overexpressors were smaller than those of WT plants (DREB2C-overexpressors: 4.5 ± 2.1 mm; WT, 14.7 ± 1.2 mm; n > 100) (Fig. 4b). A single DREB2C-overexpressor plant showed highly variable silique phenotypes, ranging from siliques holding mostly or exclusively viable seeds to those containing only aborted seeds or unfertilized ovules. The percentage of aborted seeds varied considerably between the two transgenic lines and among experiments, but the rate of seed abortion was consistently higher in DREB2C-overexpressors than in WT plants.",

        "question": "The stamens of transgenic and WT plants were of comparable length at stage 12 (Fig. 5a); however, at stage 14, the stamens of DREB2C-overexpressors were ~ 20% shorter than those of WT plants, which was a significant difference (P < 0.01). The stamen filament length/pistil length ratio in transgenic flowers was only ~ 0.8-fold greater than that in WT flowers along a developmental series from floral stage 12 to 14 (Fig. 5b). We speculate that even if pollen develop normally and reach maturity in transgenic lines, the short stamen filaments cause pollination failure, resulting in seed abortion, unfertilized ovules, and small siliques.",
        "answer": "At stage 12, the stamens of transgenic and wild-type (WT) plants were similar in length, but by stage 14, the stamens of DREB2C-overexpressors were about 20% shorter than those of WT plants, a significant difference. The stamen filament length to pistil length ratio in transgenic flowers was approximately 0.8 times that of WT flowers from stage 12 to 14. This suggests that despite normal pollen development, the shorter stamen filaments in transgenic lines may lead to pollination failure, resulting in seed abortion, unfertilized ovules, and small siliques.",

        "question": "The resulting metabolite profiles were compared and significant differences determined to identify compounds that are secreted by Col-0 and not by plants with a defect in coumarin biosynthesis. Results are listed in Tables S3 and S4 in File S7. Scopoletin was identified as one of the most intense signals in the exudates of wild-type plants even under control conditions. Only traces were detectable in the exudates of the mutant, confirming the lack of synthesis in f6′h1-5 mutant plants [23]. As an additional metabolite downstream of F6′H1 we detected esculetin (Fig. 5, 1) in the exudates. Thus, coumarins appear to be secreted by A. thaliana roots and could indeed be involved in the mobilization of extracellular insoluble Fe(III).",

This allowed an assessment of the growth rate of different leaves of the rosette on a protein basis. We assessed protein content by protein extraction and amido black measurement (Supplemental Data Set 1) and by imaging gel-separated proteins from whole leaves ground into sample buffer (Supplemental Figure 1B and Supplemental Data Set 1). Leaf 3 increased its total protein content by only 3% per day, in contrast to leaves 5 and 7, which grew at 3 and 5 times this rate, respectively (Figure 1). As a consequence, leaf 7 nearly doubled in size and total protein content over five days while leaf 3 hardly grew at all.",

        "question": "Assuming that cellular respiration is the primary net ATP production source in leaves, the relative proportion of ATP used for protein synthesis and degradation could also be determined using leaf respiration rates of the Arabidopsis rosette (Sew et al., 2013). In leaves that are not growing (e.g., leaf 3 in this study), synthesis of new protein is simply replacing degraded protein and would cost 13% of cellular ATP. By contrast, in leaf 7, which was rapidly growing, synthesis costs reached 38% of total respiratory ATP (Figure 7A). This analysis also showed that the overall ATP cost of protein degradation was ∼4% of respiratory ATP synthesis across all leaf types.",

As in several mammalian BAG proteins, four of the predicted plant BAG family members possess ubiquitin domains in the N terminus, whereas three plant BAG proteins (AtBAG5-7) contain a calmodulin-binding motif near the BD, a novel feature associated with plant BAG family members. As with the structure of bag genes, the domain structure correlates with the predicted cellular localization of Arabidopsis BAG family proteins.

        "question": "The clustering of AtBAG6 with the cold-induced protein Samui from B. mori as revealed by our phylogenic analysis of BAG proteins suggested a possible role for AtBAG6 in cold responses. Thus, atbag6 induction was analyzed in the leaf tissue of Arabidopsis plants at 0, 20, and 90 min after exposure to -20 °C for 10 min (supplemental Fig. S3). In parallel, we analyzed the induction kinetics of atbag4. atbag4 induction was detected 20 min after cold stress. In contrast, atbag6 transcripts were not observed until 90 min after cold treatment, indicating that atbag4 is a more rapidly induced cold-responsive gene compared with atbag6.",
        "answer": "The phylogenetic analysis of BAG proteins indicates a potential role for AtBAG6 in cold responses, similar to the cold-induced protein Samui from B. mori. In Arabidopsis, atbag6 expression was analyzed after exposure to -20 °C, showing that atbag6 transcripts appear 90 minutes post-treatment. In contrast, atbag4 is induced more rapidly, with transcripts detected 20 minutes after cold stress, suggesting atbag4 is a quicker responder to cold conditions than atbag6.",

        "question": "Phenotypes of the atbag4 and atbag6 Knock-out Lines—Transgenic lines with T-DNA insertions in the exons of atbag4 and atbag6 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and the Syngenta Arabidopsis Insertion Library. Knock-out plants were grown under long-day conditions (16 h of light/8 h of dark). All heterozygous knock-out lines exhibited earlier flowering and shorter vegetative and reproductive phases, producing more branched roots and inflorescences compared with wild-type plants (Fig. 4A). These plants senesced earlier than the wild-type plants, indicating that BAG proteins influence plant growth and development.",

        "question": "Thus, the localization of the Arabidopsisd-CDes in the cell was investigated experimentally by two different approaches. Total protein extracts and protein extracts from isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts (≈15µg each) were subjected to western blot analysis using a monospecific d-CDes antibody. In total extracts a single band was recognized at ≈ 43 kDa indicating the presence of the full-length protein, in mitochondria three bands at about 42, 43 and 44 kDa were detected, while no bands were visible in chloroplast extracts (Fig. 3). One could assume that in mitochondria the unprocessed protein, the mature protein and a post-translationally modified protein might be present. N-terminal sequencing and analysis of peptides by MS could help to verify this explanation.",

        "question": "Using a best reciprocal BLAST approach, we found 1:1 A. lyrata orthologs for 3,868 of the 5,789 A. thaliana network genes. For each pair of orthologs, the impact of natural selection was inferred from the nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence ratio (ω = dN/dS). Values of ω = 1 are expected for genes evolving neutrally, whereas ω < 1 is indicative of the action of purifying selection preserving the sequence of the encoded proteins, and ω > 1 in a number of codons is indicative of the action of positive selection (adaptive evolution) driving the fixation of nonsynonymous substitutions. The estimated ω values exhibit a median of 0.128, indicating that these genes evolved under relatively high levels of selective constraint",

Remarkably, the correlation coefficient was negative for 18 of the 20 categories (table 2). The correlation was significant for only five of these categories, probably as a result of the reduced statistical power resulting from partitioning the data set. These observations indicate that, in spite of the fact that genes with different functions exhibit different ω and centrality values, the negative correlation between centrality and ω is largely independent of gene function.",

        "question": "These observations suggested that the flowering time association peak centered on chr4:1355057 could partly be due allelic variation at NDX1 (Fig. 4A). To explore this further, we performed GWAS while including the chr4:1355057b haplotype as a cofactor to regress out the effect of the NDX1 polymorphism (Fig. 4B). Doing so did not eliminate the significant peak on chromosome 4 (suggesting that NDX1 is not the only causal variant), but moved it over 100 Kbp in the opposite direction of NDX1. The “new” peak was quite broad and flat, but the second strongest association (chr4:1236543; −log10p-value = 11.85; MAC = 15) was 1.1 Kbp downstream of another well-known flowering regulator, GIBBERELLIC ACID REQUIRING 1 (GA1 Chr4:1237671..1244822) that is essential for gibberellic acid biosynthesis (Sun and Kamiya 1994).",

        "question": "For example, we found no relationship between latitude and freezing tolerance in North America, where A. thaliana is believed to have been recently introduced (O'Kane & Al-Shehbaz 1997). Perhaps more surprising is that the association between latitude and freezing tolerance becomes weaker at high latitudes in the native species range. In particular, the trend is stronger for accessions collected from mainland Europe than for accessions collected in Sweden. Given the strong negative correlation between latitude and temperature, this may indicate that there is a minimum temperature beyond which diminishing returns for additional freezing tolerance occur (i.e. a non-linear fitness function). However, it is also possible that other environmental factors are involved.",

        "question": "To examine this further, we considered the relationship between freezing tolerance and 19 climate variables related to seasonal and annual trends in precipitation and temperature (Hijmans et al. 2005). In agreement with the analysis of latitude, the climate variable that best predicts the freezing tolerance of accessions from continental Europe is the mean temperature of the coldest quarter (Fig. 3), with the odds of survivorship lower (Table 2) for accessions native to warm regions (P = 8.13 × 10−24). For Swedish accessions, freezing tolerance is not associated with variables related to the temperature at the site of origin. Instead, we found modest evidence that the odds of survival in Sweden increase with the amount of precipitation in the original habitat. Although snow is widely assumed to protect plants from sub-freezing air temperatures, it also maintains the ambient temperature near the melting point of water, which increases the likelihood of cellular damage due to ice recrystallization (Griffith & Yaish 2004; Gudleifsson 2010).",

        "question": "GWAS for mCHH levels of 9,228 individual TEs that are present in all 774 lines showed a very similar pattern to GWAS for individual TE families. Although the AGO1 peak was much weaker, the signals at NRPE1’, CMT2b’, and CMT2a’ remain strong even at the level of individual TEs, with NRPE1’ explaining 6.6% of the average mCHH variation on RdDM-targeted TEs, whereas the two CMT2 alleles each explain about 4% (total 6.4%) of the variation on CMT2-targeted TEs (Fig 2B). Because the effect sizes are so large, and because the genes target different chromosomal regions (NRPE1 mainly affects TEs in chromosome arms, whereas CMT2 targets TEs in pericentromeric regions; see Fig 2B), these polymorphisms contribute substantially to shaping the genome-wide landscape of mCHH levels (Fig 2C), and the remainder of this paper will focus on them.",

        "question": "Anthocyanin accumulation for 360 natural accessions of Arabidopsis was evaluated by visual scoring of rosette-stage plants grown under control conditions or osmotic stress conditions. Each plant was assigned to a category ranging from a completely green plant (category 1) to a completely red/purple plant (category 5) (Fig 1A). These categories correlated very well with anthocyanin content as determined by spectrophotometric analyses (Fig 2). Most plants (66%) did not produce any visible anthocyanins under control conditions and only very few accumulated substantial levels (Fig 3). PEG treatment, however, induced anthocyanin accumulation in almost all accessions, with most plants being assigned to category 3 and more than 98% to category 2 or higher (Fig 3A). Levels of accumulation were highly reproducible among replicates of accessions within and between experiments.",

        "question": "A weak significant correlation was found between the latitude and the accumulation of anthocyanins under control (ρ = 0.15, p = 0.006) and stress (ρ = 0.13, p = 0.023) conditions. This suggests a trend of northern accessions accumulating more anthocyanin than southern accessions (Fig 1B). However, as can be expected from the weak clines, accessions with different accumulation phenotypes often occur in close range of each other. In the United Kingdom, for example, accessions of the whole range of accumulation under both control and stress conditions occur, indicating that macro climate is not the most important factor determining selection of constitutive and stress-induced anthocyanin accumulation.",
        "answer": "A weak but significant correlation exists between latitude and anthocyanin accumulation, with northern accessions tending to accumulate more than southern ones under both control and stress conditions. However, accessions with varying accumulation phenotypes often coexist closely, as seen in the UK, suggesting that macro climate is not the primary factor influencing anthocyanin accumulation.",

For 10 of the 12 accessions the calmoduline-like gene was not significantly up-regulated upon osmotic stress (Fig 5), suggesting that it is very unlikely that this gene is causal for the observed variation in anthocyanin accumulation. In contrast, all MYB genes were up-regulated upon osmotic stress in all accessions tested, except MYB114, which was not up-regulated in Ty-0. This up-regulation confirms the role of these genes in stress responses.",

Meanwhile, we also compared the values of Fv/Fm, EK, and Y(NPQ) between the two groups, and no significant difference was detected (with q values > 0.05 for all). These results indicate that the photosynthesis of Wantian 2015 could recover to a normal state soon after the heat stress disappeared, with more efficient photosynthesis and less dissipation.",

        "question": "Normal soil was then layered over the seeds, followed by regular watering. After about three weeks of growth, the soil was carefully washed away, allowing us to capture phenotypic photographs and measure root lengths (Figure 1). Under loosened soil conditions, the primary root length of the ZmSPL12 overexpression lines was significantly shorter than that of wild-type plants. Notably, an increase in soil hardness led to a significant suppression of root growth in wild-type plants. In contrast, the overexpression lines displayed a notably lesser inhibition of primary root growth compared to the wild-type (Figure 1a,b). These results revealed that ZmSPL12 overexpression lines have longer roots than wild-type plants in compacted soil conditions.",

Similar to those found in soil, the primary root length of the ZmSPL12 OE lines grown in test tubes with normal BD was shorter than those of wild-type plants.

        "question": "The results revealed that soil compaction leads to significantly reduced root cap length in wild-type plants, whereas the ZmSPL12 OE lines exhibited only minimal change in this trait. Statistical analysis showed that the number of cell layers within the root cap remained comparable between the genotypes regardless of soil compaction, indicating that compaction might primarily inhibit root cap cell elongation. In particular, the ZmSPL12 OE lines displayed resilience to this compaction effect. Measurements of the root elongation zone showed that soil compaction drastically shortened cell length and broadened cell width in both genotypes. Nevertheless, in the ZmSPL12 OE lines, the cell length within the elongation zone was relatively unaffected, although there was a slight increase in cell width. These findings were in line with earlier studies, which reported that plants exposed to soil compaction displayed shorter roots and increased root diameters [12,33].",
        "answer": "Soil compaction significantly reduces root cap length in wild-type plants, but ZmSPL12 OE lines show minimal changes. The number of cell layers in the root cap remains similar across genotypes, suggesting compaction mainly affects cell elongation. Both genotypes experience shortened cell length and increased cell width in the root elongation zone due to compaction. However, ZmSPL12 OE lines maintain cell length with only a slight increase in width, aligning with previous findings of shorter roots and increased diameters under compaction.",

        "question": "One ZmbHLH121-CRISPR mutant was identified with a 5-bp Cas9-induced deletion at the second gRNA target site in exon 3 (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). No significant difference in bHLH121 transcript levels was observed in the mutant compared with its wild-type background (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). However, 5-bp deletion caused a frameshift, leading to formation of a premature stop codon (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S7B). The translated amino acid sequence of the mutant allele thus diverged from the wild-type sequence after amino acid 177; therefore lacking a portion of the predicted DNA-binding motif and all of the protein–protein interaction motif (Fig. 2C). The RCA phenotype in roots of the homozygous ZmbHLH121-CRISPR mutant was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type FBLL MAB background in the greenhouse (Fig. 4).",

        "question": "Under full irrigation, no difference among lines was detectable in plant height, ASI, or yield traits (Figure 4A–C). By contrast, under water deficit conditions, plant height decreased by 4.40–12.17 cm in all maize lines (Figure 4D). Notably, under water deficit, grain yield in both pyramided plants was greater than that of WT plants, and ASI was significantly shorter (2.96–3.42 days versus 5.17 days) in WT (Figure 4E,F). The phenotypic results of different genotypes in 2020 (Figure S1) are consistent with those in 2019 (Figure 4). These collective results indicated that stacking ZmVPP1 and ZmNAC111 could enhance maize drought resistance to improve yields during water deficit in the field.",

Over 16% of the individual lipids were markedly lower in the smk10, and 8.5% were markedly higher (Fig. 4f). As the endosperm cell size in smk10 was smaller than that of wild-type (Fig. S7a,b), the increased absolute contents of lipids in smk10 might due to the large number of cells per unit weight of kernel.

To further investigate its subcellular localization, the constructs of ZmWAX2-YFP, an endoplasmic reticulum-located protein marker (ER-RFP), and a Golgi-located protein marker (ERD4-RFP) were co-transformed into the maize protoplasts. Fluorescent signals of ZmWAX2-YFP overlapped with both ER and Golgi markers (Figure 2d), consistent with its possible role in cuticular wax biosynthesis and transportation.",

On the other hand, FarmCPU model which uses both the fixed effect model and the random effect model iteratively, able to completely remove the confounding from kinship by using a fixed-effect model without a kinship derived either from all markers, or associated markers. This process overcomes the model overfitting problems of stepwise regression (Liu et al. 2016).

Thus, we analyzed the expression levels of MADS26 in different haplotype lines under ethylene treatment. In the roots, the relative expression levels of MADS26 in haplotype II-lines showed a continuous increase across different germination stages under control conditions (Fig. 4c). However, in the roots of haplotype III-lines, its expression abundance reached a peak on the 5 d and then returned to a lower level following the germination process in the control (Fig. 4c). Under the ethylene treatment, however, MADS26 presented a continuously upregulated expression in the roots of both haplotypes (Fig. 4d). Generally, the expression patterns of MADS26 in the shoots of both haplotypes were consistent between the control and ethylene conditions across different germination stages (Fig. 4e, f).",

        "question": "The seed germination test is routinely performed to evaluate the range of pollutant concentrations producing plant growth and development inhibition (OECD, 1984, EPA, 1986, APAT, 2002). In this study, maize seeds were exposed to increasing concentrations of chromium, ranging from 2 to 1500 ppm, and after 72 h the number of germinated seeds was counted and root lengths were measured. The percentage germination index (IG) in Fig. 1 was computed from combined data. Reduction of growth parameters was scored for all concentrations tested; at low potassium dichromate concentration (2–20 ppm) the damage was not fatal. An IG of 30% was observed at exposures of 50–100 ppm. Consistent growth inhibition was observed starting from 300 ppm of potassium dichromate (Fig. 1) with the highest inhibition occurring at 1200 ppm. These data indicate that maize is less sensitive to chromium than other plants species such as Trifolium repens (Citterio et al., 2002) or Brassica napus L. (Labra et al., 2004) and suggests that maize is a tolerant species, in agreement with observations from other authors (Mishra et al., 1995, Sharma et al., 2003). However the biochemical changes involved in tolerance were not clarified by previous investigations.",

After 72 hours, germination and root lengths were measured. Low concentrations (2–20 ppm) caused non-fatal damage, while 50–100 ppm resulted in a 30% germination index. Significant growth inhibition began at 300 ppm, peaking at 1200 ppm. Maize showed higher tolerance to chromium compared to other species like Trifolium repens and Brassica napus, although the biochemical basis for this tolerance remains unclear.",

        "question": "In the case of maize, an induction of MTs synthesis was detected starting from 2 ppm potassium dichromate (Fig. 2).

The highest concentration of MTs was obtained at 600 ppm of potassium dichromate. This suggests that there could be an enhanced role for MTs in plants under Cr stress. A clear role for MTs in plants has not been well established yet, although they are thought to play a role in metal metabolism (functioning as antioxidants) and/or in plasma membrane repair mechanisms.",

FL1 is the first characterized ER membrane protein surrounding the PB, and affects PB biogenesis most likely by facilitating 22-kDa α-zein deposition (Holding et al., 2007). We also identified an ortholog (GRMZM2G007871_P01, No. 1168) of the Arabidopsis J domain ER membrane protein AtERdj2A, which is essential for growth in Arabidopsis as it affects pollen germination (Yamamoto et al., 2008). In addition, its yeast ortholog Sec63p is required for cell growth by mediating protein translocation across the ER membrane (Rothblatt et al., 1989). Additionally, several integral membrane proteins were found, including four emp24/gp25L/p24 family/GOLD family members and three endomembrane protein 70 isoforms, both of which are implicated in sorting and packaging cargos for ER export via binding between the coated protein and their cytoplasmic domains (Anantharaman and Aravind, 2002; Gao et al., 2012).",

        "question": "To determine whether the sHSP26 could protect PS II under heat stress, the rate of oxygen evolution/electron transport of PS II from protoplasts was measured under heat, PQ and/or RNAi treatments. Regardless of RNAi or not, PS II electron transport rates (in terms of oxygen evolution) were significantly lower in the protoplasts under heat and PQ treatment compared to the control, although there was a greater reduction in the PS II activity of protoplasts when the expression of maize sHSP26 was inhibited (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the sHSP26 may protect PS II against heat and oxidative stresses.",

        "question": "Typically, sugars are a source of carbon and energy (Koch, 2004). Moreover, some sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose also act as signalling molecules in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (Zaragoza et al., 2009). Upon Fe3O4 NP exposure, there were no significant changes in the total sugar in maize leaves, but the ratio of reducing sugar to non-reducing sugar changed (Fig. S3A). The presence of Fe3O4 NPs slightly increased the reducing sugar content and decreased the non-reducing sugar content. Interestingly, there were no effects on roots exposed directly to NPs (Fig. S3B).",
        "answer": "Sugars serve as carbon and energy sources and can act as signaling molecules in plant stress responses. In maize leaves exposed to Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the total sugar content remained unchanged, but the ratio of reducing to non-reducing sugars shifted, with an increase in reducing sugars and a decrease in non-reducing sugars. No effects were observed in roots directly exposed to the nanoparticles.",

These metabolites and their structures were listed in Supplementary Table S4. However, formate could not be determined in most of the samples subjected to salt stress alone and combined stress. On the basis of the characteristics of metabolites, we further classified the metabolites listed in Table 1 into 11 groups (Group A to Group K). Group A consisted of sugars. The amounts of Suc and Fru in this group significantly increased under different stress conditions, whereas the amount of glucose significantly decreased. Group B comprised various metabolites, such as those involved in glycolysis and other metabolites linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The metabolites in group C were organic acids involved in the TCA cycle. In this study, drought-treated leaf extracts showed increased amounts of Pyr, Ino, For, Succ, and MA; by comparison, the extracts exposed to combined stresses revealed increased amounts of CA and Ino but decreased amount of Fum. However, all of these metabolites were detected at similar levels in the salt stress-exposed extracts compared with the control plants.",

About 41% (26 out of 63) of these genes are related with photosynthesis and their up-regulation by PBZ at 24 HAI followed by a down-regulation at 36 HAI might be a strategy to anticipate the transition to autotrophic growth in the absence of energetic resources resulting from proper GA signaling. This gene set encodes chloroplast ATP synthase subunits, RuBisCO, chloroplast ribosomal proteins, DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoC1), YCF3, and several photosystem I and II subunits.",

We used the elbow method, which enables the determination of the number of clusters by the curve’s elbow (Figure S2). Using the elbow approach, we detected three clusters/groups (i.e., K = 3), with groups I, II, and III containing 92, 105, and 160 landraces, respectively, all three of which were found to have varying degrees of admixture.",

        "question": "The rate of glucose utilization by cells is known to be influenced by various environmental factors [25]. One of the outcomes of the current study was to observe the effects of heat stress on carbohydrate metabolism, specifically in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Oxidative PPP is a major source of reducing power and metabolic intermediates for several biosynthetic processes in the cell, and apparent change in the cellular abundance of certain PPP metabolites often severely affects several other metabolism pathways [26]. Analysis of this study revealed that during heat stress, the amount of major glycolysis and PPP metabolites, such as glucose, dihydroxy acetone phosphate and pyruvate, decreased drastically compared to the control treatment (Figure 2 and Figure 3, and Table S2).",
        "answer": "The study investigated the impact of heat stress on carbohydrate metabolism, focusing on glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). It found that heat stress significantly reduces the levels of key metabolites like glucose, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and pyruvate, which can severely affect other metabolic pathways.",

        "question": "Increases in valine and leucine upon drought stress can also result from the consistent increase in the substrate pyruvate, which also featured in our GC-MS-based results [44]. The relative increase of isoleucine and leucine (Figure 4, and Table S2) in drought-stressed soybean leaves were in agreement with previous findings in Arabidopsis [45]. Glycine and proline are two major organic osmolytes that were highly accumulated (Figure 4) in response to drought stress [46,47]. Very high accumulation of cellular proline and glycine under drought stress was also observed in our study, which clearly shows the potential for an advanced tolerance response during adverse environmental conditions, such as drought, in soybeans.",

        "question": "Specifically, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides directly participate in nucleic acid synthesis, which provides the ultimate energy source for the synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, peptides and secondary metabolites [55]. The de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway (orotate pathway) is defined as the formation of uridine monophosphate (UMP)from carbamoyl phosphate (CP), orotate, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), and a few other phosphate metabolites [56]. Our metabolomics profiling result indicates that the major building blocks, which are pyrimidine bases such as thymine, cytosine and uracil, are reduced significantly upon heat stress, which affects overall pyrimidine biosynthesis and nucleic acid biosynthesis (Figure 6).",

        "question": "In similar conditions in other studies, glyphosate reduced root growth (length and weight) of susceptible soybean [21]. Consistent with the cited reports, glyphosate also reduced the root length of susceptible soybean seedlings (Fig. 1). In contrast, glyphosate did not affect the root growth of GR soybeans—an expected result because this cultivar tolerates the herbicide. However, since glyphosate residues and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were found in GR soybean seeds in field’s conditions [22], growth and yield cannot be assumed to be unchanged. Glyphosate reduced the root growth of GR soybeans in greenhouse studies [23], but did not affect soybean growth in field experiments [24]. At least for the short-term experimental conditions reported in this work, the root length of GR soybeans was unaffected by glyphosate treatment.",

        "question": "The cultivar Jiaoda 133 is a vegetable soybean, and Williams 82 is a grain soybean; there are several seed phenotypic differences between them. The Jiaoda 133 pods harvested at the R6 stage (stage 6) (Fig. 1A) and boiled in water for 7 min, tasted sweet, soft and fragrant, whereas those of Williams 82 were hard and neither sweet nor fragrant. For vegetable soybean, the sweet taste is a key trait. To check out which sugar contributed to the sweet taste, we measured the content of four sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose) in fresh seeds at the stage R6. The sucrose content was significantly higher in Jiaoda 133 (2.39 g/100 g) than Williams 82 (1.52 g/100 g). The contents of fructose and glucose were low, with no significant differences between Jiaoda 133 and Williams 82. No maltose was detected (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the sweet taste was determined mainly by sucrose content. The pods and fresh grains of Jiaoda 133 were much larger than those of Williams 82 at various developmental stages (Fig. 1A). At maturity, the 100-grain weight of Jiaoda 133 was 31.38 g and that of Williams 82 was 17.87 g (that 1.75-fold difference was significant) (Fig. 1C).",

        "question": "The sweeter taste is one of the major differences between grain and vegetable soybeans, which is determined by the higher sucrose content in vegetable soybean. Therefore, we focused on the expressions of genes related to sucrose metabolism and transport. Genes for sweet and waxy corn had been studied, and eight genes of maize endosperm mutant have been used for commercial breeding, including shrunken2 (sh2), brittle1 (bt1), brittle2 (bt2), sugary1 (su1), sugary enhancer1 (se1), amylose extender1 (ae1), dull endosperm1 (du1), and waxy1 (wx1) (Yang and Wang, 2005). The expression of most genes homologous to sh2, bt1 and su1 was higher in Williams 82 than Jiaoda 133 (Fig. 6A), which would contribute to accumulation of sucrose in Jiaoda 133. In contrast, the expression of genes homologous to bt2, se1, ae1, and du1 was lower in Williams 82 than Jiaoda 133 (Fig. 6A), which could increase the amylopectin content and contribute to waxy taste in Jiaoda 133. The expression patterns of two genes homologous to wx1 were opposite in the two genotypes (Fig. 6A), potentially leading to no difference in amylose",

        "question": "To evaluate the influence of haplotypes on soybean seed traits, we examined the association between haplotypes and seed oil content in soybean collections. Hap_S has a very low seed oil content but very high seed protein content (Fig. 6d,e). This result was consistent with well-documented characteristics of wild soybean seeds, which are very small, black, have low oil content, but are rich in protein. In cultivated soybeans, Hap_H displayed a high seed oil content and low protein content, whereas Hap_W showed a relatively low seed oil content but high protein content (Fig. 6d,e). With respect to the contrasting seed oil and protein content of Hap_H and Hap_W described above, it is possible that Hap_H and Hap_W may reflect the two classic breeding goals of achieving high oil or high protein varieties, respectively.",
        "answer": "The study examined the relationship between haplotypes and seed oil content in soybeans. Hap_S is characterized by low oil and high protein content, similar to wild soybeans. In cultivated soybeans, Hap_H has high oil and low protein content, while Hap_W has low oil and high protein content.

        "question": "For centuries, soybean breeders from the northern regions of China have had more enthusiasm to develop varieties with high seed oil contents. Next, we wondered about the reflection of the haplotypes of GmMFT on the soybean breeding traditions in China. An examination of the geographic distribution of the haplotypes in China indicated that Hap_H displayed a decreasing trend from the high-latitude to low-latitude regions. In Northeast China, the frequency of Hap_H is > 88%. However, it decreased to 66% and 34.5% in Central and South China, respectively. By contrast, an opposite trend was observed for Hap_W, whose frequency is < 5% in Northeast China, 32% in Central China, and > 63% in South China (Fig. 6l). Taken together, these results indicated that the frequencies and distribution of the haplotypes of GmMFT coincided with the soybean breeding traditions in China, suggesting that GmMFT was a hot locus that has been popularly selected for soybean breeding.",
        "answer": "For centuries, soybean breeders in northern China have focused on developing high seed oil content varieties. The geographic distribution of GmMFT haplotypes reflects this tradition, with Hap_H being more prevalent in high-latitude regions like Northeast China (>88%) and decreasing towards the south. Conversely, Hap_W is less common in the north (<5%) and more frequent in Central (32%) and South China (>63%). These patterns suggest that GmMFT is a significant locus in soybean breeding in China.",

        "question": "A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis was conducted to establish groups of homology within the GmMIP gene family. The 66 GmMIPs were classified into various subfamilies including 22 GmPIPs, 23 GmTIPs, 13 GmNIPs, six GmSIPs and two new GmXIPs i.e., uncharacterized isoforms (Fig. 1 and Tables 1 & 2). The GmXIPs might be similar to the novel plant AQP subfamily XIP recently reported in moss [15] and tomato [16]. All the members of the GmPIPs subfamily localized to plasma membranes (Table 1). The predicted localization of members of the GmTIPs subfamily was diverse, and predicted localization included cytosol, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole, mitochondria and chloroplast. From the GmNIPs subfamily, GmNIP1;1 and GmNIP4;1 localized to vacuoles, GmNIP2;2 to extra-cellular structures and the rest to plasma membranes. Two members of the GmSIP subfamily localized to vacuoles and the remainder to plasma membranes. GmXIP1;1 localized to extra-cellular structures and GmXIP1;2 to cytosol.

We calculated the Δ(SNP index) based on the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) index of the male-fertile and male-sterile pool. The Δ(SNP index) graph (Figure 3B) contains a straight line indicating confidence value of 99%. The Δ(SNP index) value should be significantly different from 0 if the genomic region harbors the candidate gene. At the 99% significance level, the only region with a value significantly different from 0, was a region of chromosome 13 spanning 16.15 kb (21,132,960-21,149,112). This finding indicated that the genes controlling fertility are located in this 16.15 kb region (Figure 3A, B); this mapping interval is consistent with the Ms1 gene (20,933,886-23,1150,16) (Figure 3C)",

        "question": "Combined with the above analysis of the localization interval, transcriptome analysis of genes within and near the candidate region showed that five genes were significantly down-regulated in the sterile group (Table S2). Among these is a gene encoding the kinesin-like protein NACK2. TES, Arabidopsis homolog of NACK2 (amino acid identity 64%), encodes TETRASPORE, which is required for meiotic cytokinesis; the Arabidopsis mutant tes has the same cytological characteristics as soybean ms1 sterile plants. The expression of GmMs1 was almost undetectable in sterile plants, the transcript level was significantly different from that in fertile individuals (Figure S2A). The results of transcriptome sequencing were further verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Figure S2B), further supporting the idea that GmMs1 is the gene affected by the ms1 mutation.",

NACK2's Arabidopsis homolog, TETRASPORE, is crucial for meiotic cytokinesis, and the Arabidopsis tes mutant shares characteristics with sterile soybean ms1 plants.

The GmMTP8.1 protein includes 294 amino acid residues (33.1 kDa) and possesses common features of Mn-CDF transporters, such as four putative TMDs, cation efflux, and ZT dimer domains (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2). The consensus sequence DxxxD (x = any amino acid) localizes to the first TMD and the cytosolic loop of GmMTP8.1 (Supplementary Figure 3). In addition, based on amino acid sequence comparisons, GmMTP8.1 shares a high degree of homology identity (90.8%) with ShMTP8 in S. hamata, and shares 83.3% identity with HvMTP8.1 in barley, 83% identity with OsMTP8.1 in rice, 83% identity with CsMTP8 in cucumber, and 81% identity with AtMTP8 in Arabidopsis, which were the representative MTP8-like proteins included in group 8 (Supplementary Figures 3–5).

The findings indicate that SymRKs phosphorylate Gα proteins at their active site, leading to a loss of GTP binding and GTPase activity in vitro.",

        "question": "To test the interaction between native and variant Gα1 proteins and Gβ, the full-length proteins were expressed as prey (NUb fusions) and bait (CUb fusions), respectively, in the split-ubiquitin interaction system. In this assay, all native Gβ proteins (Gβ1–Gβ4) interacted with the native Gα1 and with the phospho-deficient Gα1 (Gα1quadA), but intriguingly no interaction was observed with Gα1quadD (Figure 6a). To corroborate these interactions in planta, native Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD proteins were transiently co-expressed with Gβ and Gγ proteins in tobacco leaves. We used two soybean Gβ proteins (Gβ2 and Gβ3), which belong to two different subgroups, and three different Gγ proteins (Gγ1, Gγ5 and Gγ9), representing each of the Gγ subgroups (Roy Choudhury et al., 2011), to test the tripartite interaction of Gβγ with Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD. In these assays, Gα1quadD also did not show any interaction, whereas the native Gα1 as well as Gα1quadA exhibited strong interactions with all tested combinations of Gβγ proteins (Figures 6b and S12). These data imply that the inability of the phosphorylated Gα proteins to interact with Gβγ, thereby making them constitutively available, is most likely to be the critical regulatory aspect of G-protein signaling during nodulation.",
        "answer": "The study tested interactions between native and variant Gα1 proteins and Gβ in a split-ubiquitin system. Native Gβ proteins interacted with native Gα1 and phospho-deficient Gα1 (Gα1quadA) but not with Gα1quadD. In tobacco leaves, native Gα1 and Gα1quadA showed strong interactions with Gβγ proteins, while Gα1quadD did not. This suggests that phosphorylated Gα proteins' inability to interact with Gβγ is a key regulatory factor in G-protein signaling during nodulation.",

        "question": "From the diurnal variation of the photosynthetic rate of different soybean varieties under cloudy conditions (Figure 4B), it can be seen that, influenced by the cloudy weather, the high-yield variety Changnong 39 exhibits a brief midday photosynthetic rest phenomenon. The maximum photosynthetic rate of the population occurs between 10:00 and 11:00. For the conventional varieties Jiyu 441 and Changnong 35, the midday photosynthetic rest phenomenon is not obvious, showing a single peak curve. Among them, the maximum photosynthetic rate of the Jiyu 441 population occurs earlier than that of Changnong 39.",

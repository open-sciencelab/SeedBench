        "question": "Among them, Bg1-D has the most obviously increased grain size (Fig. 1A). Compared with WT (Nipponbare, Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), the 1,000-grain weight of Bg1-D has increased about 33.8%, with the grain length and grain width increased about 15.2% and 17.0%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Observation of spikelet hull by scanning electron microscopy showed that the epidermis cells of both palea and lemma in Bg1-D are much longer than that of the WT (Fig. S1). Careful examination of the hull cross-section before flowering revealed significant increases of both number and area of the parenchyma cells in the Bg1-D mutant (Fig. 1 C and D). Consistent with this, a number of genes associated with cell cycle and cell expansion were up-regulated in the panicles of the Bg1-D mutant (Fig. S2). Despite the greatly enlarged grain size, Bg1-D also exhibits enhanced growth of other tissues at both the vegetative and reproductive stages (Fig. 1E and Fig. S3). One-week-old seedlings of the Bg1-D mutant have obviously increased length of leaf and root compared with WT (Fig. S3 A–D). When plants enter reproductive stage, the leaves of Bg1-D are longer and wider than those of the WT plants, and the Bg1-D also has increased plant height (Fig. 1E, Fig. S3E, and Table S1). In addition, the Bg1-D panicles are much larger than those of the WT (Fig. S3 F and G).we overexpressed BG1 cDNA under the control of the rice ACTIN1 promoter in WT and found that the BG1overexpressing plants (BG1-OE) showed obviously increased grain size and other phenotypes, such as enhanced plant height, longer leaves, and larger panicles, which resemble the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes (Fig. 2C and Fig. S6 A and B). Importantly, severity of the phenotypes was apparently correlated with the BG1 expression level; that is, plants with higher BG1 expression have bigger grain size as well as increased 1,000-grain weight (Fig. 2 D–G), demonstrating that activation of BG1 is the cause for the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes.\nWhat alterations were noted in the Bg1-D mutant's cells?\nA. Increased area of parenchyma cells\nB. Decreased number of parenchyma cells\nC. Down-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle and cell expansion\nD.

        "question": "To determine whether OsSPL14 underlies the IPA1 QTL, we performed a confirmation test by generating transgenic plants expressing different levels of OsSPL14 in the Nipponbare and Ri22 lines, the japonica varieties suitable for gene transformation. We introduced the plasmid carrying OsSPL14 (designated gOsSPL14), which contained a 7.2-kb genomic DNA fragment, into Nipponbare (see Online Methods). The gOsSPL14 transgenic lines had reduced tillers, stronger culms and increased panicle branches and grain yield (Supplementary Fig. 4). In contrast, the OsSPL14 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants in the Ri22 background generated more tillers and showed a marked reduction in plant height, diameter of culms, panicle branches and grain number (Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, we concluded that OsSPL14 is the gene responsible for ideal plant architectur and grain number (Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, we concluded that OsSPL14 is the gene responsible for ideal plant architecture.\nWhat were the observed effects in the gOsSPL14 transgenic lines?\nA. Reduced tillers\nB.

        "question": "The mutant osfie1 produced smaller seeds and displayed reduced dormancy, indicating that OsFIE1 predominantly functions in late seed development.

C16 and C18 fatty acids are then elongated to VLCFAs by the fatty acid elongase (FAE) complex, consisting of b-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), b-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, b-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydratase, and enoylCoA reductase, on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). VLCFA elongation involves a four-step reaction cycle: First, the condensation of C16 and C18 acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA is catalyzed by KCS, yielding b-ketoacylCoA; second, the reduction of b-ketoacyl-CoA is catalyzed by b-ketoacyl-CoA reductase; third, the resulting b-hydroxy acyl-CoA is dehydrated by b-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydratase; and fourth, the enoyl acylCoA is reduced by enoyl-CoA reductase. Each cycle results in an acyl-CoA with a two-carbon extension (Kunst and Samuels, 2009). The generated VLCFACoAs are then thiolysed to yield free fatty acids or are used further in an acyl reduction (alcoholforming) pathway, yielding primary alcohols, or a decarbonylation (alkane-forming) pathway, yielding aldehydes and alkanes (Kunst and Samuels, 2003; Samuels et al., 2008)\nWhich compounds serve as the starting materials in the biosynthesis of wax?\nA.

        "question": "To test this prediction, we introduced both Ghd8 alleles of 93–11 (Ghd8 (93–11)) and Nipponbare (Ghd8(Nip)) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into NILZS, which has a small panicle, short stature, and early heading compared to NILHR5. The T1 families of the T0 transformants containing a single-copy of the Ghd8 (93–11) and (Ghd8 (Nip)) alleles were analyzed for their phenotypic effects under natural LD conditions (13–14-h day length). The positive T1 plants showed significantly more grains, delayed heading and taller culms compared to the transgenic negative plants (Figure 1). The negative Ghd8 transgenic plants (NILZS–) showed a performance similar to their recipient line NILZS in heading date, grain yield, grains per panicle, and plant height (Table 1). On average, a positive T1 plant (NIL93–11+/NILNip+) resulted in increases above 60% in grain yield per plant and grains per panicle compared to the recipient NILZS and the negative T1 plant (NILZS–) (Figure 1). The NILNip+ plant showed a performance similar to that of the NIL carrying the HR5 homozygotes (NILHR5) in grain yield, grains per panicle, and plant height; however, the transformants with the Ghd8 (93–11) allele were delayed in flowering by 9 d, thus indicating the strong effect of the 93–11 allele on heading date (Table 1). In summary, the complementary test confirmed that the candidate gene was in fact Ghd8.When compared to ZS97, ZS97Nip flowered earlier and later under SD and LD conditions, respectively (Table 2). That is to say, the Ghd8 allele of Nipponbare promoted flowering under SD conditions and inhibited flowering under LD conditions in ZS97. We also compared the diurnal expression of OsMADS51 (Kim et al., 2008) under SD conditions, that of OsMADS50 under LD conditions and that of OsGI, Hd1, Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 under both conditions between positive and negative transgenic plants (ZS97Nip+ and ZS97Nip–). There was no difference in diurnal expression for OsGI, OsMADS51, OsMADS50, and Hd1, but a distinct difference was observed for Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 between ZS97Nip+ and ZS97Nip– (Figure 3A and 3B). These results indicated that Ghd8 acts upstream of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1. \nWhat approaches were employed in the research?\nA. Compared the performance of positive and negative T1 plants.\nB.

        "question": "Two independent floral regulators, Hd1 and Ehd1,control flowering through regulating Hd3a and RFT1 in rice (Izawa 2007; Tsuji et al. 2011). To investigate whether the alteration of expression patterns of the two ‘florigen’ genes by EF8 is mediated by Hd1, Ehd1 or other regulators of Hd1 and Ehd1, such as OsMADS51, OsMADS50 and OsGI (Hayama et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2010), we examined their mRNA levels between wild type and the ef8 mutant under LDs and SDs. Under LDs, to our surprise, no significant differences in the expression of any of these genes were detected between ef8 mutant and wild type (Fig. 5a). Under SDs, the expression pattern of Ehd1 was slightly changed in ef8 mutant compared to wild type, but the expression patterns of other genes were not changed (Fig. 5b). Together, these results indicated that EF8 delayed flowering through altering the rhythmic expression patterns of the ‘florigen’ genes Hd3a and RFT1 independently of Hd1 and Ehd1 under LDs.\nThe ef8 mutant displayed a slightly darker green leaf phenotype and more chlorophyll content compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. S1), which suggested that EF8 may have effect on chlorophyll biogenesis. To test this, we extracted total RNAs from 30-dayold leaves of wild-type and ef8 mutant seedlings under both LDs and SDs, and performed QRT-PCR to examine the expression of genes encoding the enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in rice. Most of these genes were up-regulated to different degrees except chlorophyll synthetase (CHLG)in ef8 mutant compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 6a). For example, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM) and NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A (PORA) were up-regulated more than threefold, and Mg chelatase H subunit (CHLH) and divinyl reductase (DVR) about twofold. However, there were no significant differences in the transcription level of these genes under SDs (Fig. 6b). This result indicated that the higher chlorophyll content was due to higher expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes in the ef8 mutant compared to wild type and EF8 negatively regulated chlorophyll biogenesis under LDs.\nWhat did the study primarily investigate?\nA.

        "question": "Two independent floral regulators, Hd1 and Ehd1,control flowering through regulating Hd3a and RFT1 in rice (Izawa 2007; Tsuji et al. 2011). To investigate whether the alteration of expression patterns of the two ‘florigen’ genes by EF8 is mediated by Hd1, Ehd1 or other regulators of Hd1 and Ehd1, such as OsMADS51, OsMADS50 and OsGI (Hayama et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2010), we examined their mRNA levels between wild type and the ef8 mutant under LDs and SDs. Under LDs, to our surprise, no significant differences in the expression of any of these genes were detected between ef8 mutant and wild type (Fig. 5a). Under SDs, the expression pattern of Ehd1 was slightly changed in ef8 mutant compared to wild type, but the expression patterns of other genes were not changed (Fig. 5b). Together, these results indicated that EF8 delayed flowering through altering the rhythmic expression patterns of the ‘florigen’ genes Hd3a and RFT1 independently of Hd1 and Ehd1 under LDs.\nThe ef8 mutant displayed a slightly darker green leaf phenotype and more chlorophyll content compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. S1), which suggested that EF8 may have effect on chlorophyll biogenesis. To test this, we extracted total RNAs from 30-dayold leaves of wild-type and ef8 mutant seedlings under both LDs and SDs, and performed QRT-PCR to examine the expression of genes encoding the enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in rice. Most of these genes were up-regulated to different degrees except chlorophyll synthetase (CHLG)in ef8 mutant compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 6a). For example, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM) and NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A (PORA) were up-regulated more than threefold, and Mg chelatase H subunit (CHLH) and divinyl reductase (DVR) about twofold. However, there were no significant differences in the transcription level of these genes under SDs (Fig. 6b). This result indicated that the higher chlorophyll content was due to higher expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes in the ef8 mutant compared to wild type and EF8 negatively regulated chlorophyll biogenesis under LDs.\nWhat was the impact of EF8 on the biogenesis of chlorophyll under LDs?\nA. EF8 did not affect chlorophyll biogenesis.\nB. EF8 negatively regulated chlorophyll biogenesis.\nC. The effect of EF8 on chlorophyll biogenesis is unknown.\nD. EF8 positively regulated chlorophyll biogenesis.",

        "question": "We isolated a rice bglu6 mutant (04Z11IG62) with a T-DNA insertion in the sixth intron of the gene (Fig. 1a). Molecular analysis revealed that this T-DNA insertion resulted in no detectable expression ofBGLU6in leaves and roots (Fig. S1a,b). Phenotypic analysis showed that disruption of BGLU6 led to a 46.2% and 66.9% decrease in seedling plant height compared to the WT, at 7 and 14 d post-transplantation, respectively (Figs 1b, S1c,d). The dwarf phenotype was present throughout the entire growth and development stages (Figs 1b, S1c,d). By contrast, no difference was seen in root length of bglu6compared to the WT root length (data not shown). To confirm the role ofBGLU6on plant height, we generated bglu6 RE and OE transgenic rice lines by introducing an Ubiquitin-driven construct harboring BGLU6 (Fig. S2a). The plant height ofBGLU6RE lines were 93.2% that of the WT, indicating a nearly complete restoration of height through expression of BGLU6 in the mutant. BGLU6OE lines had a plant height of 120.5% of the WT (Fig. S2b,c). Likewise, no obvious difference was seen in root length and weight between these genotypes (data not shown). b-glucosidases have been reported to hydrolyze inactive ABAGE, and result in an increase in the endogenous ABA concentration. To investigate if the dwarfism is related to cellular ABA concentration, we examined the endogenous ABA content in leaves of the WT and the bglu6mutant at the seedling stage. ABA content in bglu6was 68.2% that of the WT (Fig. 1c). We also examined leafGA3 content and no difference was seen between the WT and the bglu6mutant (Fig. 1c), suggesting the enzyme is specific for hydrolysis of ABA-GE. Furthermore, spraying 10 lMABA onto bglu6leaves partly restored the plant height ofbglu6(Fig. 1d). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption of BGLU6 affects ABA concentration in leaves, resulting in a dwarfism in the mutant.\nUnder normal conditions, the hydrolysis activity ofABA-GE in the OE-5 line was 22.6% higher than that of the WT (Fig. 2c). After 2 d of drought stress, the hydrolysis activity in the WT and the OE-5 line was increased to 121% and 105% of activity before the treatment (Fig. 2c). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that BGLU6 hydrolyzes ABA-GE to ABA in vitro, and that this activity can be enhanced by drought stress.\nOf the downregulated DEGs, seven were related to stress. Of these, heat shock protein 81-2 (OS09G0482100), SPX domaincontaining protein (OS02G0202200) and embryonic abundant protein (OS05G0349800) were downregulated the most (Table S4). Four DEGs that participate in photosynthesis were identified, with ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain (OS01G0791033), ATP synthase subunit beta, chloroplastic (OS10G0355800) downregulated the most (Table S3). Besides these, we also found that positive regulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis process (GO0010116) was significantly enriched in the DEGs. The expression patterns of these DEGs were confirmed by q-RT-PCR analysis (Fig. S5). Taken together, the above results suggest that disruption of BGLU6 affects chloroplastic oxidative stress and lowers the photosynthesis efficiency, even under normal condition.\nBecause disruption of BGLU6 resulted in a decrease in endogenous ABA concentrations in leaves, and BGLU6 was localized to the chloroplast, we examined the stomatal characteristics of WT, bglu6, RE and OE lines in leaves. Under normal conditions, bglu6had significantly increased stomatal density, at 157.5% that of the WT. The increased stomatal density could be restored by expressing BGLU6 in the mutant, whereas in the OE line the density was not significantly different from that of the WT (Fig. 6a,c). After drought stress, stomatal density was slightly higher in these genotypes compared to that before treatment, except in the OE line, which had equivalent stomatal densities to those before stress (Fig. 6a,c). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption ofBGLU6affects stomatal density in leaves.\nWhat were the effects of the T-DNA insertion on the rice bglu6 mutant?\nA.

To confirm the role ofBGLU6on plant height, we generated bglu6 RE and OE transgenic rice lines by introducing an Ubiquitin-driven construct harboring BGLU6 (Fig. S2a). The plant height ofBGLU6RE lines were 93.2% that of the WT, indicating a nearly complete restoration of height through expression of BGLU6 in the mutant. BGLU6OE lines had a plant height of 120.5% of the WT (Fig. S2b,c). Likewise, no obvious difference was seen in root length and weight between these genotypes (data not shown). b-glucosidases have been reported to hydrolyze inactive ABAGE, and result in an increase in the endogenous ABA concentration. To investigate if the dwarfism is related to cellular ABA concentration, we examined the endogenous ABA content in leaves of the WT and the bglu6mutant at the seedling stage. ABA content in bglu6was 68.2% that of the WT (Fig. 1c). We also examined leafGA3 content and no difference was seen between the WT and the bglu6mutant (Fig. 1c), suggesting the enzyme is specific for hydrolysis of ABA-GE. Furthermore, spraying 10 lMABA onto bglu6leaves partly restored the plant height ofbglu6(Fig. 1d). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption of BGLU6 affects ABA concentration in leaves, resulting in a dwarfism in the mutant.\nUnder normal conditions, the hydrolysis activity ofABA-GE in the OE-5 line was 22.6% higher than that of the WT (Fig. 2c). After 2 d of drought stress, the hydrolysis activity in the WT and the OE-5 line was increased to 121% and 105% of activity before the treatment (Fig. 2c). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that BGLU6 hydrolyzes ABA-GE to ABA in vitro, and that this activity can be enhanced by drought stress.\nOf the downregulated DEGs, seven were related to stress. Of these, heat shock protein 81-2 (OS09G0482100), SPX domaincontaining protein (OS02G0202200) and embryonic abundant protein (OS05G0349800) were downregulated the most (Table S4). Four DEGs that participate in photosynthesis were identified, with ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain (OS01G0791033), ATP synthase subunit beta, chloroplastic (OS10G0355800) downregulated the most (Table S3). Besides these, we also found that positive regulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis process (GO0010116) was significantly enriched in the DEGs. The expression patterns of these DEGs were confirmed by q-RT-PCR analysis (Fig. S5). Taken together, the above results suggest that disruption of BGLU6 affects chloroplastic oxidative stress and lowers the photosynthesis efficiency, even under normal condition.\nBecause disruption of BGLU6 resulted in a decrease in endogenous ABA concentrations in leaves, and BGLU6 was localized to the chloroplast, we examined the stomatal characteristics of WT, bglu6, RE and OE lines in leaves. Under normal conditions, bglu6had significantly increased stomatal density, at 157.5% that of the WT. The increased stomatal density could be restored by expressing BGLU6 in the mutant, whereas in the OE line the density was not significantly different from that of the WT (Fig. 6a,c). After drought stress, stomatal density was slightly higher in these genotypes compared to that before treatment, except in the OE line, which had equivalent stomatal densities to those before stress (Fig. 6a,c). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption ofBGLU6affects stomatal density in leaves.\nWhat alterations were noted in terms of hydrolysis activity and stomatal density when subjected to drought stress?\nA. The hydrolysis activity in the WT and the OE-5 line increased.\nB. The stomatal density was slightly higher in these genotypes compared to that before treatment.\nC. The stomatal density in the OE line was lower than before stress.\nD. The hydrolysis activity in the WT and the OE-5 line decreased.",

        "question": "knockout lines (KO-GL10) harbored a frameshift mutation that caused premature termination of translation (Fig. S4A and S4B). These KO-GL10 lines exhibited significantly decreased grain length, grain width, and 1000-grain weight compared to those of the HJX74 wild-type line (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E). In addition, heading date differed significantly between KO-GL10 and HJX74 (Fig. S4C), although we found no detectable differences in plant height, effective tiller numbers, or grain number (Fig. S4DeS4F). We also generated a genetic complementation construct for GL10 overexpression in the NIL-gl10 background via transformation with a p35S-GL10 vector (Fig. S5A and S5B). The GL10 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased grain length and grain weight compared to that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. 2B, 2F, 2G, 2H). Moreover, OE-GL10 grain phenotypes were distinct from that of KO-GL10 plants, with grain length and heading date positively correlating with GL10 expression level.

In addition, we found no significant differences between OE-GL10 and NIL-gl10 in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant (Fig. S5DeS5F).

The seedborne F. verticillioides seed rot of the mature asymptomatic seeds from the respective genotypic ears was investigated as described previously (Ma et al., 2022). All three transgenic maize lines displayed greater resistance to internal seedborne F. verticillioides seed rot than the B104 lines, and their disease indexes of seed rot were significantly reduced by 40–66.7% (Figures 4b,c), consistent with much lower levels of internal F. verticillioides accumulation in the seeds from inoculated ears (Figure 4d). However, the seeds of ZmWAX2-overexpressing lines and B104 from water-inoculated (Mock) ears showed undetectable symptoms of seed rot (Figure 4b–d).\nZmWAX2 过表达玉米品系对哪种病害显示出更强的抵抗力？\nA. 内部种子霉变\nB. 叶片霉变\nC. 外部种子霉变\nD. 茎部霉变",

On the other hand, FarmCPU model which uses both the fixed effect model and the random effect model iteratively, able to completely remove the confounding from kinship by using a fixed-effect model without a kinship derived either from all markers, or associated markers. This process overcomes the model overfitting problems of stepwise regression (Liu et al. 2016).

        "question": "For centuries, soybean breeders from the northern regions of China have had more enthusiasm to develop varieties with high seed oil contents. Next, we wondered about the reflection of the haplotypes of GmMFT on the soybean breeding traditions in China. An examination of the geographic distribution of the haplotypes in China indicated that Hap_H displayed a decreasing trend from the high-latitude to low-latitude regions. In Northeast China, the frequency of Hap_H is >?88%. However, it decreased to 66% and 34.5% in Central and South China, respectively. By contrast, an opposite trend was observed for Hap_W, whose frequency is <?5% in Northeast China, 32% in Central China, and >?63% in South China (Fig. 6l).

        "question": "The 66 GmMIP sequences were also analyzed for distribution of introns and exons; the results are shown in Fig. 2 (also see Fig. S4). The number of introns ranged from zero (in GmSIP1;5 and GmSIP1;6) to 5 (in GmNIP1;4 and GmNIP4;1). The division into five subfamilies based on comparison of the deduced protein sequences (see above) was mirrored in the intron-exon structures. All GmPIPs included three introns except GmPIP2;13 which contained four introns (intron # 1 is additional intron). For the GmTIPs, two introns were usual, but three genes: GmTIP1;7, GmTIP1;8 and GmTIP1;9 contained only one intron while one gene GmTIP5;1 contained three introns. GmNIPs contained variable introns with the majority characterized by 4 introns. GmNIP5;1 lacked one intron (intron # 2), GmNIP6;2 lacked two introns (intron # 2 and 3) while GmNIP1;4 and GmNIP4;1 each had five introns. GmSIPs contained two introns except GmSIP1;5 and GmSIP1;6 which included no intron. GmXIPs have a single intron. All the AtPIPs, PtPIPs and some of OsPIPs have three introns, however, some OsPIPs contained fewer and one member OsPIP2;8 contained no intron [29], [30]. In AtTIPs, PtTIPs and OsTIPs, the pattern was more varied; the majority of the genes contained two introns and the others either one or none.

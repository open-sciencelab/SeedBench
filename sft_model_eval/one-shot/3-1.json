        "question": "Field tests of these plant lines inBeijing in 2018 revealed that OsDREB1C overexpression led to increases in grain yield per plant of 45.1 to 67.6% and in yield per plot of 41.3 to 68.3% compared with wild-type (WT) plants (Fig. 1C). Conversely, OsDREB1C KO resulted in yield decreases (from 16.1 to 29.1% in yield per plant and 13.8 to 27.8% in yield per plot) compared with the WT (Fig. 1, D and E, and table S1). A detailed phenotypic analysis showed that the higher yield of the OsDREB1C-OE lines was mainly attributable to an enhanced grain number per panicle and an increased 1000-grain weight (Fig. 1F and fig. S3C), traits apparently resulting from increased secondary branch number and grain length, width, thickness, and density (fig. S3, A and B and D to K, respectively). The OsDREB1C-OE plants exhibited higher grain yield but reduced strawweight compared withWT plants (Fig. 1G), thus leading to an increased harvest index (the ratio of grain yield to aboveground biomass; Fig. 1H) and raising the possibility that OsDREB1C controls resource allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues. The harvest index of OsDREB1C-OE plants was increased by 40.3 to 55.7%, whereas it was decreased by 22.4 to 33.7% in OsDREB1C-KO plants (table S1). In addition, key grain quality traits were enhanced in OsDREB1C-OE plants, suggesting that yield improvement does not entail a quality penalty (table S2).Leaves of\nOsDREB1C-OE plants contained higher levels\nof photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and\ncarotenoids) compared with WT plants, where-\nas pigment levels were reduced in OsDREB1C-\nKO plants (fig.

Analysis of carbon and nitrogen distribution showed that the OsDREB1C-OE plants accumulated more carbon and nitrogen in the grains, but less in their mature leaves, without substantial alterations in the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (Fig. 3H and fig.

        "question": "hirteen OsDT11-overexpressing lines were obtained, and three of them (pU1301::OsDT11-1,3, and 4) were selected for determination of the transcript level. When the plants were 15 days old, both the overexpressing and wild-type lines were deprived of water for 17 days. After the treatment, most of the wild-type plants withered, while the overexpressing lines exhibited less wilting compared with the control plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). Water was then supplied for 7 days, resulting in the recovery of all of the transgenic lines but not the wild-type plants (Fig. 4a, panel RW). OsDT11 expression in the transgenic plants was significantly correlated with water loss (r = −0.855, Fig. 4b, c). To further confirm the function of OsDT11 in drought tolerance, the knockdown transgenic lines were also examined under drought stress conditions. The transgenic plants were found to be more sensitive to drought stress than the wildtype plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). After rewatering for 7 days, neither the transgenic nor the wild-type lines recovered (Fig. 4a, panel RW). The water loss of the wild-type plants was approximately 10 % lower than that of the suppressed plants. Additionally, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the OsDT11 expression level in the knockdown lines was associated with water loss (r = −0.767, Fig. 4b, c). These results indicate that the overexpression of OsDT11 improves the tolerance to drought stress in rice. To further evaluate the physiological mechanism by which OsDT11 enables the plant to retain water, the stomata and wax on the leaf surface of wild-type and transgenic plants were visualized by ESEM. It was found that the stomatal size was smaller on the leaf surface of wildtype plants under drought stress conditions, compared with the wild-type plants under normal condition (Fig. 5a, b). However, there was no obvious difference between the overexpressing lines and wild-type plants under normal conditions, and the overexpression lines after drought treatment (Fig. 5c, d). Similar results were observed for the calculated stomatal density. Only the drought-stressed wild-type plants presented as higher stomatal density on the leaves than the others three samples (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, there was no obvious difference between the wax distribution of the wild-type and transgenic lines under normal conditions, and a reduction in wax content was only observed for wild-type lines after drought treatment (Fig. S3). These results indicate that OsDT11 overexpression may improve water retention by modulating stomatal density.To test whether ABA biosynthesis was affected in the transgenic plants, the endogenous ABA levels in the overexpressing and wild-type lines were measured under normal conditions and were found to be 16.25 ng g−1FW on average in the wild-type seedlings, while they were increased to 61.56, 35.91, and 24.96 ng g−1FW in the three different pU1301::OsDT11 lines, respectively (Fig. 8). These findings suggested that the ABA concentration was highly increased in the overexpressing seedlings, demonstrating that ABA biosynthesis was affected in the OsDT11 transgenic plants.\nIn the study where OsDT11 was overexpressed in rice to enhance drought resistance, how many lines overexpressing OsDT11 were generated for the research?\nA. 3\nB. 10\nC. 7\nD. 13",

When the plants were 15 days old, both the overexpressing and wild-type lines were deprived of water for 17 days. After the treatment, most of the wild-type plants withered, while the overexpressing lines exhibited less wilting compared with the control plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). Water was then supplied for 7 days, resulting in the recovery of all of the transgenic lines but not the wild-type plants (Fig. 4a, panel RW). OsDT11 expression in the transgenic plants was significantly correlated with water loss (r = −0.855, Fig. 4b, c). To further confirm the function of OsDT11 in drought tolerance, the knockdown transgenic lines were also examined under drought stress conditions. The transgenic plants were found to be more sensitive to drought stress than the wildtype plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). After rewatering for 7 days, neither the transgenic nor the wild-type lines recovered (Fig. 4a, panel RW). The water loss of the wild-type plants was approximately 10 % lower than that of the suppressed plants. Additionally, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the OsDT11 expression level in the knockdown lines was associated with water loss (r = −0.767, Fig. 4b, c). These results indicate that the overexpression of OsDT11 improves the tolerance to drought stress in rice. To further evaluate the physiological mechanism by which OsDT11 enables the plant to retain water, the stomata and wax on the leaf surface of wild-type and transgenic plants were visualized by ESEM. It was found that the stomatal size was smaller on the leaf surface of wildtype plants under drought stress conditions, compared with the wild-type plants under normal condition (Fig. 5a, b). However, there was no obvious difference between the overexpressing lines and wild-type plants under normal conditions, and the overexpression lines after drought treatment (Fig. 5c, d). Similar results were observed for the calculated stomatal density. Only the drought-stressed wild-type plants presented as higher stomatal density on the leaves than the others three samples (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, there was no obvious difference between the wax distribution of the wild-type and transgenic lines under normal conditions, and a reduction in wax content was only observed for wild-type lines after drought treatment (Fig. S3). These results indicate that OsDT11 overexpression may improve water retention by modulating stomatal density.To test whether ABA biosynthesis was affected in the transgenic plants, the endogenous ABA levels in the overexpressing and wild-type lines were measured under normal conditions and were found to be 16.25 ng g−1FW on average in the wild-type seedlings, while they were increased to 61.56, 35.91, and 24.96 ng g−1FW in the three different pU1301::OsDT11 lines, respectively (Fig. 8). These findings suggested that the ABA concentration was highly increased in the overexpressing seedlings, demonstrating that ABA biosynthesis was affected in the OsDT11 transgenic plants.\nIn the study of enhancing drought resistance in rice through the overexpression of OsDT11, what was the relationship between the expression of OsDT11 in the genetically modified plants and water loss?\nA. r = 0.767\nB. r = -0.855\nC. r = 0.855\nD. r = -0.767",

All the transgenic plants overexpressing the full-length coding sequence of LOC_Os02g25230 (derived from IL55) in the tac4-mutant background displayed the small tiller angle phenotype, similar to IL55 (Figure 2b–e). Using RNA interference (RNAi), we generated LOC_Os02g25230 knockdown plants in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare background. The RNAi transgenic plants exhibited greater tiller angles compared with control plants, indicating that the decreased expression of LOC_Os02g25230 significantly increased tiller angle (Figure 2f–h). Therefore, we concluded that LOC_Os02g25230 corresponds to the TAC4 gene and that the expression level of TAC4 was negatively correlated with tiller angle.the introgression line IL55 harbouring the tac1 allele (Aida et al., 1997), which displays an extremely compact tiller angle in the indica rice variety IR24 background, was mutagenized with ethyl methane sulphonate to generate a mutant library for screening plants with large tiller angles. One such mutant, tac4, was identified. During both the vegetative and reproductive stages, tac4 always exhibited a greater tiller angle than IL55 (Figure 1a and b, and Figure S1), and at the heading stage, the tiller angle was ~13.2° in the tac4 mutant, while it was only ~5.2° in the IL55 (Figure 1c and d). The heights of tac4 plants were reduced ~20% compared with those of IL55 and mainly resulted from the shortened uppermost internode (Figure S2a–c). Observations of longitudinal sections of the uppermost internode revealed that cell lengths were significantly decreased in tac4, indicating that the decreased cell elongation could be the main cause of the reduced tac4 plant height (Figure S2d). We found that the panicle length was shorter, and the primary and secondary branches and the grain number per panicle were significantly reduced, compared with IL55 (Table S1). The grain length of tac4 was shorter than that of IL55, and the mean 1000-grain weight was less (Figure S3).

        "question": "The function of LOC_Os02g25230 was further confirmed by genetic transformation. All the transgenic plants overexpressing the full-length coding sequence of LOC_Os02g25230 (derived from IL55) in the tac4-mutant background displayed the small tiller angle phenotype, similar to IL55 (Figure 2b–e). Using RNA interference (RNAi), we generated LOC_Os02g25230 knockdown plants in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare background. The RNAi transgenic plants exhibited greater tiller angles compared with control plants, indicating that the decreased expression of LOC_Os02g25230 significantly increased tiller angle (Figure 2f–h). Therefore, we concluded that LOC_Os02g25230 corresponds to the TAC4 gene and that the expression level of TAC4 was negatively correlated with tiller angle.the introgression line IL55 harbouring the tac1 allele (Aida et al., 1997), which displays an extremely compact tiller angle in the indica rice variety IR24 background, was mutagenized with ethyl methane sulphonate to generate a mutant library for screening plants with large tiller angles. One such mutant, tac4, was identified. During both the vegetative and reproductive stages, tac4 always exhibited a greater tiller angle than IL55 (Figure 1a and b, and Figure S1), and at the heading stage, the tiller angle was ~13.2° in the tac4 mutant, while it was only ~5.2° in the IL55 (Figure 1c and d). The heights of tac4 plants were reduced ~20% compared with those of IL55 and mainly resulted from the shortened uppermost internode (Figure S2a–c). Observations of longitudinal sections of the uppermost internode revealed that cell lengths were significantly decreased in tac4, indicating that the decreased cell elongation could be the main cause of the reduced tac4 plant height (Figure S2d). We found that the panicle length was shorter, and the primary and secondary branches and the grain number per panicle were significantly reduced, compared with IL55 (Table S1). The grain length of tac4 was shorter than that of IL55, and the mean 1000-grain weight was less (Figure S3). These observations suggest that TAC4 is pleiotropic, regulating multiple important agronomic traits.\nHow does the tac4 mutation influence the count of primary and secondary branches per panicle?\nA. It decreases the number of branches.\nB. It causes variable effects on the number of branches.\nC. It increases the number of branches.\nD. It has no effect on the number of branches.",

        "question": "To examine whether the expression of DTH8 is influenced by Hd1 and Ghd7, DTH8 expression was examined in Hd1 and Ghd7 near-isogenic lines (NILs) grown for 40 d under LD conditions. As shown in Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure S7A, the expression levels of DTH8 and Ghd7, compared with those in Nipponbare, were not changed in NIL (hd1) grown under LD conditions. However, Ehd1 and Hd3a were suppressed by Hd1 in Nipponbare. Similarly, no changes were found in the levels of DTH8 and Hd1 mRNA in the Ghd7 NILs under LD conditions. But the expressions of Ehd1 and Hd3a were also suppressed by Ghd7 (Fig. 6B; Supplemental Fig. S7B). These results indicate that DTH8 suppresses rice flowering by down-regulating the expression of Ehd1 and Hd3a, and that the expression of DTH8, Hd1,or Ghd7 is independent of each other under LD conditions..

However, since glyphosate residues and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were found in GR soybean seeds in field’s conditions [22], growth and yield cannot be assumed to be unchanged.

        "question": "The cultivar Jiaoda 133 is a vegetable soybean, and Williams 82 is a grain soybean; there are several seed phenotypic differences between them. The Jiaoda 133 pods harvested at the R6 stage (stage 6)  and boiled in water for 7 min, tasted sweet, soft and fragrant, whereas those of Williams 82 were hard and neither sweet nor fragrant. For vegetable soybean, the sweet taste is a key trait. To check out which sugar contributed to the sweet taste, we measured the content of four sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose) in fresh seeds at the stage R6. The sucrose content was significantly higher in Jiaoda 133 (2.39 g/100 g) than Williams 82 (1.52 g/100 g). The contents of fructose and glucose were low, with no significant differences between Jiaoda 133 and Williams 82. No maltose was detected . These results suggested that the sweet taste was determined mainly by sucrose content. The pods and fresh grains of Jiaoda 133 were much larger than those of Williams 82 at various developmental stages . At maturity, the 100-grain weight of Jiaoda 133 was 31.38 g and that of Williams 82 was 17.87 g (that 1.75-fold difference was significant) .\n关于Williams 82的以下描述中，哪一项是准确的？\nA. 豆荚甜、软且芳香  \nB. 蔗糖含量高于Jiaoda 133  \nC. 豆荚硬、不甜、不芳香  \nD. 100粒种子重量为31.38 g  ",

In Northeast China, the frequency of Hap_H is >?88%. However, it decreased to 66% and 34.5% in Central and South China, respectively. By contrast, an opposite trend was observed for Hap_W, whose frequency is <?5% in Northeast China, 32% in Central China, and >?63% in South China . Taken together, these results indicated that the frequencies and distribution of the haplotypes of GmMFT coincided with the soybean breeding traditions in China, suggesting that GmMFT was a hot locus that has been popularly selected for soybean breeding.\nGmMFT单倍型的分布模式与哪个领域的传统相符？\nA. 水稻育种\nB. 小麦育种\nC. 玉米育种\nD. 大豆育种",

        "question": "To test the interaction between native and variant Gα1 proteins and Gβ, the full-length proteins were expressed as prey (NUb fusions) and bait (CUb fusions), respectively, in the split-ubiquitin interaction system. In this assay, all native Gβ proteins (Gβ1–Gβ4) interacted with the native Gα1 and with the phospho-deficient Gα1 (Gα1quadA), but intriguingly no interaction was observed with Gα1quadD . To corroborate these interactions in?planta, native Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD proteins were transiently co-expressed with Gβ and Gγ proteins in tobacco leaves. We used two soybean Gβ proteins (Gβ2 and Gβ3), which belong to two different subgroups, and three different Gγ proteins (Gγ1, Gγ5 and Gγ9), representing each of the Gγ subgroups (Roy Choudhury et al.,?2011), to test the tripartite interaction of Gβγ with Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD. In these assays, Gα1quadD also did not show any interaction, whereas the native Gα1 as well as Gα1quadA exhibited strong interactions with all tested combinations of Gβγ proteins . These data imply that the inability of the phosphorylated Gα proteins to interact with Gβγ, thereby making them constitutively available, is most likely to be the critical regulatory aspect of G-protein signaling during nodulation.\n在split-ubiquitin相互作用系统中，哪种Gα1变体与所有本地Gβ蛋白（Gβ1–Gβ4）产生了相互作用？\nA.

        "question": "To test the interaction between native and variant Gα1 proteins and Gβ, the full-length proteins were expressed as prey (NUb fusions) and bait (CUb fusions), respectively, in the split-ubiquitin interaction system. In this assay, all native Gβ proteins (Gβ1–Gβ4) interacted with the native Gα1 and with the phospho-deficient Gα1 (Gα1quadA), but intriguingly no interaction was observed with Gα1quadD . To corroborate these interactions in?planta, native Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD proteins were transiently co-expressed with Gβ and Gγ proteins in tobacco leaves. We used two soybean Gβ proteins (Gβ2 and Gβ3), which belong to two different subgroups, and three different Gγ proteins (Gγ1, Gγ5 and Gγ9), representing each of the Gγ subgroups (Roy Choudhury et al.,?2011), to test the tripartite interaction of Gβγ with Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD. In these assays, Gα1quadD also did not show any interaction, whereas the native Gα1 as well as Gα1quadA exhibited strong interactions with all tested combinations of Gβγ proteins . These data imply that the inability of the phosphorylated Gα proteins to interact with Gβγ, thereby making them constitutively available, is most likely to be the critical regulatory aspect of G-protein signaling during nodulation.\n在in planta测定中，哪种Gα1变体无法与任何Gβγ蛋白组合进行相互作用？\nA.

        "question": "The results revealed that soil compaction leads to significantly reduced root cap length in wild-type plants, whereas the ZmSPL12 OE lines exhibited only minimal change in this trait. Statistical analysis showed that the number of cell layers within the root cap remained comparable between the genotypes regardless of soil compaction, indicating that compaction might primarily inhibit root cap cell elongation. In particular, the ZmSPL12 OE lines displayed resilience to this compaction effect. Measurements of the root elongation zone showed that soil compaction drastically shortened cell length and broadened cell width in both genotypes. Nevertheless, in the ZmSPL12 OE lines, the cell length within the elongation zone was relatively unaffected, although there was a slight increase in cell width.

A subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between FaMYB63 and the AtSOS1 gene promoter. As depicted in Fig. 8B, the FaMYB63-GST complex bound to the MBS element in the AtSOS1 promoter, leading to a mobility shift. This observation suggests that FaMYB63 binds to a DNA fragment containing the MBS element in the AtSOS1 promoter, thereby regulating its expression.

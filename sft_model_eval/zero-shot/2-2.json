        "question": "Field tests of these plant lines inBeijing in 2018 revealed that OsDREB1C overexpression led to increases in grain yield per plant of 45.1 to 67.6% and in yield per plot of 41.3 to 68.3% compared with wild-type (WT) plants (Fig. 1C). Conversely, OsDREB1C KO resulted in yield decreases (from 16.1 to 29.1% in yield per plant and 13.8 to 27.8% in yield per plot) compared with the WT (Fig. 1, D and E, and table S1). A detailed phenotypic analysis showed that the higher yield of the OsDREB1C-OE lines was mainly attributable to an enhanced grain number per panicle and an increased 1000-grain weight (Fig. 1F and fig. S3C), traits apparently resulting from increased secondary branch number and grain length, width, thickness, and density (fig. S3, A and B and D to K, respectively). The OsDREB1C-OE plants exhibited higher grain yield but reduced strawweight compared withWT plants (Fig. 1G), thus leading to an increased harvest index (the ratio of grain yield to aboveground biomass; Fig. 1H) and raising the possibility that OsDREB1C controls resource allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues. The harvest index of OsDREB1C-OE plants was increased by 40.3 to 55.7%, whereas it was decreased by 22.4 to 33.7% in OsDREB1C-KO plants (table S1). In addition, key grain quality traits were enhanced in OsDREB1C-OE plants, suggesting that yield improvement does not entail a quality penalty (table S2).Leaves of\nOsDREB1C-OE plants contained higher levels\nof photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and\ncarotenoids) compared with WT plants, where-\nas pigment levels were reduced in OsDREB1C-\nKO plants (fig. S7A). Analysis ofleafmesophyll\ncells revealed that both chloroplast number\nand sizewere increased in OsDREB1C-OE plants\n(fig.S7, Band C).. Analysis of carbon and nitrogen distribution showed that the OsDREB1C-OE plants accumulated more carbon and nitrogen in the grains, but less in their mature leaves, without substantial alterations in the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (Fig. 3H and fig.

        "question": "We field-tested 2 or 3 T1 families randomly selected from T0 plants. Compared with the negative segregants, elevated DEP1 accumulation increased the grain length by 6.85–9.58% with a normal plant stature. However, plants overexpressing dep1 showed very similar phenotype to DEP1Ri plants, both of which reduced grain length by ~4.5%, together with dwarf stature and erect panicles (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). The expression level of endogenous DEP1 in dep1OE was not reduced (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Thus dep1 showed a dominant-negative effect over DEP1 in regulating grain size rather than cosuppression of the two genes. In contrast to DEP1OE, GS3-1OE showed an average 9.07% reduction in grain length together with reduced plant stature, very similar to the phenotype of dep1OE (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). GS3-4OE produced even smaller plants and grain size with an average 19.10% reduction of grain length relative to the negative segregant, while GS3-1Ri resulted in an average 5.78% increase of grain length. These results were similar to those of Mao et al39.It was shown that knocking out DEP1 in the GS3-1OE or GS3-4OE background did not further reduce the gain size of GS3-1OE or GS3-4OE (Supplementary Fig. 2d). We also crossed DEP1OE with GS3-1Ri and GS3-1OE transgenic plants. Further increased grain length was observed when overexpressing DEP1 in GS3-1Ri background, whereas the DEP1OE/GS3-1OE hybrid showed the GS3-1OE phenotype of short grain (Supplementary Fig. 2e).GS3 in grain size regulation was to repress the effects of DEP1 and GGC2 on increasing grain size.",

        "question": "Among them, Bg1-D has the most obviously increased grain size (Fig. 1A). Compared with WT (Nipponbare, Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), the 1,000-grain weight of Bg1-D has increased about 33.8%, with the grain length and grain width increased about 15.2% and 17.0%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Observation of spikelet hull by scanning electron microscopy showed that the epidermis cells of both palea and lemma in Bg1-D are much longer than that of the WT (Fig. S1). Careful examination of the hull cross-section before flowering revealed significant increases of both number and area of the parenchyma cells in the Bg1-D mutant (Fig. 1 C and D). Consistent with this, a number of genes associated with cell cycle and cell expansion were up-regulated in the panicles of the Bg1-D mutant (Fig. S2). Despite the greatly enlarged grain size, Bg1-D also exhibits enhanced growth of other tissues at both the vegetative and reproductive stages (Fig. 1E and Fig. S3). One-week-old seedlings of the Bg1-D mutant have obviously increased length of leaf and root compared with WT (Fig. S3 A–D). When plants enter reproductive stage, the leaves of Bg1-D are longer and wider than those of the WT plants, and the Bg1-D also has increased plant height (Fig. 1E, Fig. S3E, and Table S1). In addition, the Bg1-D panicles are much larger than those of the WT (Fig. S3 F and G).we overexpressed BG1 cDNA under the control of the rice ACTIN1 promoter in WT and found that the BG1overexpressing plants (BG1-OE) showed obviously increased grain size and other phenotypes, such as enhanced plant height, longer leaves, and larger panicles, which resemble the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes (Fig. 2C and Fig. S6 A and B). Importantly, severity of the phenotypes was apparently correlated with the BG1 expression level; that is, plants with higher BG1 expression have bigger grain size as well as increased 1,000-grain weight (Fig. 2 D–G), demonstrating that activation of BG1 is the cause for the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes.",

        "question": "Similarly, highly hydrolyzed amyloplasts as in WT tubes are observed in DJ5 tubes (Figure S6e,g), and lowly hydrolyzed amyloplasts as in xt6 tubes are also found in sg17 tubes (Figure S6f,h). These suggest that starch hydrolysis in xt6 PTs is much slower than that in WT PTs, which implies that starch hydrolysis may be inhibited in xt6 PTs.the a-amylase extracted from WT was treated with the methanol extract of WT and xt6 pollen, respectively, and it was found that the methanol extract of xt6 pollen significantly inhibited the a-amylase activity, and the degree of inhibition was higher than that of the methanol extract of WT pollens (Figure 6d), suggesting that there may be other a-amylase activity inhibitors besides flavonoids in the methanol extract of xt6 mutant pollen. Since flavonoids have been greatly reduced in the xt6 mutant pollen (Figure 4c), amounts of other inhibitors should be increased to make the effect of the inhibitor in the xt6 mutant greater than that of WT. Considering that triterpenoids were previously reported to be inhibitors of a-amylase (Ali et al., 2006), and that triterpenoids were significantly accumulated in the xt6 mutant pollen (Figure 4e), we further compared the inhibitory effects of flavonols (Chalcone, quercetin and kaempferol) and three commonly used triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupeol) on a-amylase. Our experiments showed that three triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupinol) could significantly inhibit the activity of a-amylase, and their inhibitory effect was even stronger than that of flavonols (Figure 6e). These data indicate that a-amylase activity is significantly reduced by mutation of OsCHS1, possibly due to the accumulation of triterpenoid inhibitors in the xt6 mutation.",

When rice plants reach maturity, the 2nd, 3rd,4th and 5th internodes showed no differences, but the 1st internode was distinctly shorter in the afd1 mutant (Figure 1D, E).Taken together, we concluded that the lodicule was prone to transformation of the lodicule into the hull and has acquired the hull identity in the afd1 mutant, and that the hull-like lodicules and the thickened hulls confined the stamens in the space bounded by the hulls and for better pollination. Additionally, 9% of afd1 florets generated awns at the top of the lemmas and the epidermal cells of awns had lots of trichomes, and no awns were formed in the florets of the wild type (Figures S3, S4A).These results suggested that the low setting percentage in the afd1 mutant was due to both inefficient pollination (i.e. the thicker hulls limited the pollination in the afd1 mutant) and defective pollen grains.eantime, the awn was observed at the top of the afd1 lemma primordium but no awn was found in the wild type (Figure 6D, H).

        "question": "esulting knockout lines (KO-GL10) harbored a frameshift mutation that caused premature termination of translation (Fig. S4A and S4B). These KO-GL10 lines exhibited significantly decreased grain length, grain width, and 1000-grain weight compared to those of the HJX74 wild-type line (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E). In addition, heading date differed significantly between KO-GL10 and HJX74 (Fig. S4C), although we found no detectable differences in plant height, effective tiller numbers, or grain number (Fig. S4DeS4F). We also generated a genetic complementation construct for GL10 overexpression in the NIL-gl10 background via transformation with a p35S-GL10 vector (Fig. S5A and S5B). The GL10 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased grain length and grain weight compared to that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. 2B, 2F, 2G, 2H). Moreover, OE-GL10 grain phenotypes were distinct from that of KO-GL10 plants, with grain length and heading date positively correlating with GL10 expression level. Notably, the heading stage of OE-GL10 was earlier than that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. S5C). In addition, we found no significant differences between OE-GL10 and NIL-gl10 in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant (Fig. S5DeS5F). These results indicate that GL10 was a positive regulator of grain length, grain weight and heading date.In addition, the SEM assays showed that HJX74 plants exhibited greater longitudinal grain length than plants from either KO-GL10 line (Fig. S6A, S6C, S6D), while the grain length of the KO-GL10 plants was similar to that of NIL-gl10 plants. We also observed that the epidermal cell sizes in spikelet hulls of the OEGL10 plants were significantly greater than in those of NIL-gl10 plants (Fig. S6B, S6E, S6F). These results indicate that GL10 controls grain length by positively influencing the length of epidermal cells in the spikelet hull.",

        "question": "The mutant osfie1 produced smaller seeds and displayed reduced dormancy, indicating that OsFIE1 predominantly functions in late seed development. Ectopic expression of OsFIE1, but not OsFIE2, was deleterious to vegetative growth in a dose-dependent manner. The newly evolved N-terminal tail of OsFIE1 was probably not the cause of the adverse effects on vegetative growth. The CRISPR/Cas9-derived mutant osfie2 exhibited impaired cellularization of the endosperm, which suggested that OsFIE2 is indispensable for early seed development as a positive regulator of cellularization. Autonomous endosperm was observed in both OsFIE2+ and osfie1/OsFIE2+ but at a very low frequency. Although OsFIE1-PRC2 exhibited H3K27me3 methyltransferase ability in plants, OsFIE1-PRC2 is likely to be less important for development in rice than is OsFIE2-PRC2.The expression of OsFIE1 in the endosperm in independent transgenic lines was significantly increased, whereas the expression of OsFIE2 was not altered in the transgenic plants (Figure 2b). Unlike the Ubi::OsFIE1 plants, the GT1::OsFIE1 lines showed vegetative development similar to that of the WT (Figure 2c). However, all three independent GT1:: OsFIE1 transgenic lines analyzed produced seeds significantly smaller than the WT seeds (Figure 2a and Figure S6). The 1000-grain weight of GT1::OsFIE1 was reduced to 86–88% of the WT value (Figure S6d). The results unambiguously indicated that overexpression of OsFIE1 could directly affect seed development.The osfie1 mutant produced smaller seeds and showed increased frequency of pre-harvest sprouting relative to the WT (Figure 3), suggesting that OsFIE1 plays roles in late seed development (Figure S13).",

        "question": "hirteen OsDT11-overexpressing lines were obtained, and three of them (pU1301::OsDT11-1,3, and 4) were selected for determination of the transcript level.

OsDT11 expression in the transgenic plants was significantly correlated with water loss (r = −0.855, Fig. 4b, c). To further confirm the function of OsDT11 in drought tolerance, the knockdown transgenic lines were also examined under drought stress conditions. The transgenic plants were found to be more sensitive to drought stress than the wildtype plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). After rewatering for 7 days, neither the transgenic nor the wild-type lines recovered (Fig. 4a, panel RW). The water loss of the wild-type plants was approximately 10 % lower than that of the suppressed plants. Additionally, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the OsDT11 expression level in the knockdown lines was associated with water loss (r = −0.767, Fig. 4b, c). These results indicate that the overexpression of OsDT11 improves the tolerance to drought stress in rice. To further evaluate the physiological mechanism by which OsDT11 enables the plant to retain water, the stomata and wax on the leaf surface of wild-type and transgenic plants were visualized by ESEM. It was found that the stomatal size was smaller on the leaf surface of wildtype plants under drought stress conditions, compared with the wild-type plants under normal condition (Fig. 5a, b). However, there was no obvious difference between the overexpressing lines and wild-type plants under normal conditions, and the overexpression lines after drought treatment (Fig. 5c, d). Similar results were observed for the calculated stomatal density. Only the drought-stressed wild-type plants presented as higher stomatal density on the leaves than the others three samples (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, there was no obvious difference between the wax distribution of the wild-type and transgenic lines under normal conditions, and a reduction in wax content was only observed for wild-type lines after drought treatment (Fig. S3). These results indicate that OsDT11 overexpression may improve water retention by modulating stomatal density.To test whether ABA biosynthesis was affected in the transgenic plants, the endogenous ABA levels in the overexpressing and wild-type lines were measured under normal conditions and were found to be 16.25 ng g−1FW on average in the wild-type seedlings, while they were increased to 61.56, 35.91, and 24.96 ng g−1FW in the three different pU1301::OsDT11 lines, respectively (Fig. 8). These findings suggested that the ABA concentration was highly increased in the overexpressing seedlings, demonstrating that ABA biosynthesis was affected in the OsDT11 transgenic plants.",

        "question": "In the present study, a dominant gene against BPH, Bph32, was cloned from the rice variety Ptb33 in an approximately 190-kb interval flanked by the markers RM19291 and RM8072 on the short arm of chromosome 6 using bioinformatics analysis and a transgenic approach. The evaluation of BPH resistance in transgenic plants confirmed the crucial function of Bph32 in BPH resistance. Bph32 encodes a short consensus repeat (SCR) domain-containing protein that confers an antibiosis resistance to BPH and is localized in the plasma membrane of the cell. This gene is highly expressed in the leaf sheaths, where the BPH first settles and feeds. The results confirm that Bph32 is a stable BPH resistance gene and provides a valuable gene for rice defence against insect pests.",

Real-time (RT) PCR analysis showed that Bph32 was expressed in all investigated tissues at the flowering stage, and its expression level was highest in leaf sheaths followed by leaf blades, culms, panicles and roots (Fig. 3a), consistent with the preference of BPH to settle and probe in leaf sheaths at the flowering stage49. Bph32 expression was further analysed in more detail using transgenic plants carrying a Bph32 promoter-driven GUS reporter gene. GUS expression was observed in the root, leaf blade, leaf sheath, culm, glume, flower, immature seed and germinating seed (Fig. 3b), and GUS activity was strongly detected in parenchyma cells and the vascular bundle (Fig. 3b1,4 and 3b2,3).

        "question": "To confirm that LOC_Os06g03240 confers BPH resistance, we transformed a susceptible indica variety, Kasalath (Ka), with the cDNA sequence of the Ptb33 Bph32 gene. Six independent transgenic events were detected using genomic southern blotting. Among them, N65-71-1-8 contains a single-copy of Bph32 and N65-2-5-2-6 contains a double-copy. Their T2:3 plants were used to measure the levels of resistance of Bph32. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, upon infestation with BPH at the seedling stage, all the wild-type control (Kasalath and TN1) and empty-vector transgenic plants died, whereas the transgenic rice plants expressing the Ptb33 Bph32 gene survived (Fig. 2a,b and c). When infected at the maturing stage, the wild-type plants exhibited leaf wilting, a decrease in seed and grain plumpness, and even death of the whole plant, whereas the Bph32 transgenic plants were all healthy (Fig. 2d). Plants have evolved three defence mechanisms for responding to insect attack: antixenosis repels or disturbs insect settling, thereby reducing colonization or oviposition; antibiosis reduces insect feeding, survival or growth rate; and tolerance helps a crop to maintain high quality and yield after insect infestation48. To explore how Bph32 is involved in plant resistance to BPH, we conducted assays to compare nymph survival and honeydew excretion between the resistant Bph32 transgenic and susceptible wild-type plants (Table S3 and Fig. 2e and f). In the nymph survival test, the number of nymphs steadily decreased on the transgenic plants but began to stabilize 8 days after infestation on the wild-type controls (Fig. 2e). Honeydew excretion in the honeydew area of the transgenic plants was significantly lower than that of the wild-type controls or TN1 plants. However, the difference in honeydew excretion between the transgenic plants and the Ptb33 plants was insignificant (Fig. 2f). These results demonstrate that BPH feeding was inhibited on the resistant Bph32 transgenic plants and suggest that Bph32 conferred an antibiosis resistance that reduced BPH feeding and survival.",

        "question": "The ability of seeds to germinate under high salinity conditions is an important indicator of salt tolerance [53]. Germination experiments were performed using the seeds of WT plants, Osjrl45 mutant lines (KO1 and KO2), and OsJRL45-OE lines (OE1 and OE2) under control (0 mM NaCl) and salt treatments (100 and 200 mM NaCl) (Fig. 4C–E). Under normal conditions, the WT, KO1, KO2, OE1, and OE2 genotypes showed no difference in the seed germination rate and seedling growth (Fig. 4C). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, compared with the WT, the shoot and root lengths of knockout mutants seedlings were significantly reduced, while those of overexpression lines seedlings were significantly increased (Fig. 4C-E). Under 200 mM NaCl stress, the KO1 and KO2 lines showed seed germination but almost no seedling growth (Fig. 4C-E).Next, we analyzed the salt tolerance of WT and all knockout and overexpressed transgenic rice at the seedling period. Under normal conditions, the WT, KO1, KO2, OE1, and OE2 genotypes showed no difference (Fig. 5A). Under salt stress, the knockout plants indicated severe wilting, while the overexpressed plants grew better than WT plants (Fig. 5A). The chlorophyll content, fresh weights and dry weights of KO1 and KO2 plants were significantly lower after treatment than before treatment, while the chlorophyll contents of OE1 and OE2 plants were lower and their fresh weights and dry weights were significantly higher (Fig. 5C-E). The survival rates (Fig. 5B), chlorophyll contents (Fig. 5C), fresh weights (Fig. 5D), and dry weights (Fig. 5E) of knockout plants seedlings were significantly lower than those of the WT plants, while those of overexpressed transgenic rice seedlings were higher under salinity stress treatments. Collectively, these results suggest that OsJRL45 positively regulates salt tolerance at the germination and seedling stages.To elucidate its biological function, the OsJRL45 gene isolated from SR86 was transformed into the salt-sensitive indica cultivar L6-23. The promoter of OsJRL45 was cloned into the pCAMBIA1300 vector, and the resultant construct was transformed into L6-23 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to create transgenic rice (named Lh). The L6-23 plants suggested severe wilting, while the Lh plants grew better than the L6-23 rice under salt stress (Fig. 7A).

The T1 families of the T0 transformants containing a single-copy of the Ghd8 (93–11) and (Ghd8 (Nip)) alleles were analyzed for their phenotypic effects under natural LD conditions (13–14-h day length). The positive T1 plants showed significantly more grains, delayed heading and taller culms compared to the transgenic negative plants (Figure 1). The negative Ghd8 transgenic plants (NILZS–) showed a performance similar to their recipient line NILZS in heading date, grain yield, grains per panicle, and plant height (Table 1). On average, a positive T1 plant (NIL93–11+/NILNip+) resulted in increases above 60% in grain yield per plant and grains per panicle compared to the recipient NILZS and the negative T1 plant (NILZS–) (Figure 1). The NILNip+ plant showed a performance similar to that of the NIL carrying the HR5 homozygotes (NILHR5) in grain yield, grains per panicle, and plant height; however, the transformants with the Ghd8 (93–11) allele were delayed in flowering by 9 d, thus indicating the strong effect of the 93–11 allele on heading date (Table 1). In summary, the complementary test confirmed that the candidate gene was in fact Ghd8.When compared to ZS97, ZS97Nip flowered earlier and later under SD and LD conditions, respectively (Table 2). That is to say, the Ghd8 allele of Nipponbare promoted flowering under SD conditions and inhibited flowering under LD conditions in ZS97. We also compared the diurnal expression of OsMADS51 (Kim et al., 2008) under SD conditions, that of OsMADS50 under LD conditions and that of OsGI, Hd1, Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 under both conditions between positive and negative transgenic plants (ZS97Nip+ and ZS97Nip–). There was no difference in diurnal expression for OsGI, OsMADS51, OsMADS50, and Hd1, but a distinct difference was observed for Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 between ZS97Nip+ and ZS97Nip– (Figure 3A and 3B).

GUS staining of the transgenic plants indicated that TAC4 was expressed in almost all the organs, including root, culm, leaf sheath, tiller base and young panicle (Figure 3a–j). Consistent with the GUS staining data, a quantitative real-time PCR analysis also showed that TAC4 was ubiquitously expressed in various rice organs, with the most abundant expression occurring in the young panicle, lamina joint, leaf sheath pulvinus and internode (Figure 3k). TAC4 mRNA in situ hybridization showed that a high TAC4 transcript abundance could be detected in the axillary and shoot apical meristem at the tillering stage (Figure 3l–o). RNA-sequencing data showed TAC4 transcripts in both the lower and upper sides of tiller bases, and the expression levels were similar (Figure S5).

        "question": "The function of LOC_Os02g25230 was further confirmed by genetic transformation. All the transgenic plants overexpressing the full-length coding sequence of LOC_Os02g25230 (derived from IL55) in the tac4-mutant background displayed the small tiller angle phenotype, similar to IL55 (Figure 2b–e). Using RNA interference (RNAi), we generated LOC_Os02g25230 knockdown plants in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare background. The RNAi transgenic plants exhibited greater tiller angles compared with control plants, indicating that the decreased expression of LOC_Os02g25230 significantly increased tiller angle (Figure 2f–h). Therefore, we concluded that LOC_Os02g25230 corresponds to the TAC4 gene and that the expression level of TAC4 was negatively correlated with tiller angle.the introgression line IL55 harbouring the tac1 allele (Aida et al., 1997), which displays an extremely compact tiller angle in the indica rice variety IR24 background, was mutagenized with ethyl methane sulphonate to generate a mutant library for screening plants with large tiller angles. One such mutant, tac4, was identified. During both the vegetative and reproductive stages, tac4 always exhibited a greater tiller angle than IL55 (Figure 1a and b, and Figure S1), and at the heading stage, the tiller angle was ~13.2° in the tac4 mutant, while it was only ~5.2° in the IL55 (Figure 1c and d). The heights of tac4 plants were reduced ~20% compared with those of IL55 and mainly resulted from the shortened uppermost internode (Figure S2a–c). Observations of longitudinal sections of the uppermost internode revealed that cell lengths were significantly decreased in tac4, indicating that the decreased cell elongation could be the main cause of the reduced tac4 plant height (Figure S2d). We found that the panicle length was shorter, and the primary and secondary branches and the grain number per panicle were significantly reduced, compared with IL55 (Table S1). The grain length of tac4 was shorter than that of IL55, and the mean 1000-grain weight was less (Figure S3). These observations suggest that TAC4 is pleiotropic, regulating multiple important agronomic traits.",

Southern blot analysis confirmed a single T-DNA insertion in ossiz2 (Supplemental Fig. S1e).The present study thus suggested a pivotal role of OsSIZ2 in exerting positive regulatory influences on the developmental responses of different morphometric traits during vegetative and reproductive growth phases. Comparative analyses of these traits in ossiz2 with ossiz1 also revealed some degree of functional redundancy between OsSIZ2 and OsSIZ1.Therefore, Pi concentration in the xylem sap was assayed in\nthe culms of wild-types (NB and DJ) and the mutants (Ri1-3 and ossiz2) grown in a pot soil up to the grain-fillingstage (Fig. 5). Pi concentration in the xylem sap  was significantly higher in Ri1-3 (~21–83%) and ossiz2 (~35%)compared with their corresponding wild-type.. Although a similar trend of significantly elevated total P concentration was also observed in these tissues of ossiz1 and ossiz2 compared with DJ, the effect was more pronounced in ossiz1 than ossiz2.the relative expression analysis of Ri1-3 and ossiz2 provided evidence towards the differential regulatory influence of OsSIZ2 on a subset of molecular entities that governs Pi homeostasis in rice.The result provided some evidences towards the regulatory influence of OsSIZ1 on OsSIZ2 in roots of the seedlings grown under different Pi regime.",

        "question": "The agronomic traits of the OE and T-DNA insertion lines were evaluated (Fig. 2E, F). Yield-related traits in Hwaseong, CR4379, and the transgenic lines were compared at maturity (Supplementary Table S4). The difference in DTH, PH, and SPP between all three OE lines and Hwaseong was significant (Fig. 2F). All OE lines had larger grains than Hwaseong, mainly due to increased GL and GW (Fig. 2E, F). The four T-DNA insertion lines showed variation in all traits measured. Insertion line #8 flowered earlier, and showed reduced PH and grain size compared with wild-type Dongjin, and line #5 was also shorter with fewer SPP and had smaller grains than Dongjin (Fig. 2F). Line #1 showed significant differences from Dongjin in PH, grain weight, and grain shape traits, and line #9 displayed a significant difference only for PH. We also evaluated MS5 T-DNA insertion mutants derived from the cultivar Hwayeong. No consistent differences in PH and DTH were observed between T-DNA insertion mutants and wild-type Hwayeong. However, the MS5 mutants all exhibited high spikelet sterility, which was consistent with a role of MS5 in grain fertility (Supplementary Table S5). These results indicate that APX9 is responsible for the QTL cluster that affects DTH, PH, SPP, GL, and GW. The performance of OE and T-DNA insertion lines suggests that the 3 bp InDel in APX9 is associated with the QTL cluster.

Among them, 8 Ehd1-OX and 11 Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines at T1 generation were flowering earlier than wild type under NDs (two representative lines of each genotype were shown in Fig. 4, A and B), demonstrating that overexpression of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the later flowering phenotype of ABF1V.To measure and compare the flowering times between Ehd1OXand Ehd1-OX/ABF1V, two independent lines of each genotype expressing equal levels of Ehd1-Flag protein were selected for the investigation (Fig. 4C). The results showed that Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines were flowering about 4 d later than Ehd1-OX lines grown in NDs. This slight flowering difference might be due to the dosage effect of Ehd1 mRNA, because the transcription of endogenous Ehd1 was suppressed in Ehd1-OX/ABF1V but not in Ehd1-OX. Alternatively, ABF1V may not repress flowering in a manner entirely dependent on the Ehd1 pathway. Furthermore, we tested if ABF1E accelerates flowering through enhancing Ehd1 expression. In total, 18 and 15 Ehd1-RNAi transgenic lines in wild-type background (Ehd1R)and ABF1E-1 background (Ehd1RNAi/ABF1E) were generated, respectively.

        "question": "a newly identified QTL, DTH8 (QTL for days to heading on chromosome 8), was found to regulate these three traits in rice. Map-based cloning reveals that DTH8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor and the complementary experiment increased significantly days to heading, plant height, and number of grains per panicle in CSSL61 (a chromosome segment substitution line that carries the nonfunctional DTH8 allele) with the Asominori functional DTH8 allele under long-day conditions. DTH8 is expressed in most tissues and its protein is localized to the nucleus exclusively. The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of Ehd1 (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions.

        "question": "To examine whether the expression of DTH8 is influenced by Hd1 and Ghd7, DTH8 expression was examined in Hd1 and Ghd7 near-isogenic lines (NILs) grown for 40 d under LD conditions. As shown in Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure S7A, the expression levels of DTH8 and Ghd7, compared with those in Nipponbare, were not changed in NIL (hd1) grown under LD conditions. However, Ehd1 and Hd3a were suppressed by Hd1 in Nipponbare. Similarly, no changes were found in the levels of DTH8 and Hd1 mRNA in the Ghd7 NILs under LD conditions. But the expressions of Ehd1 and Hd3a were also suppressed by Ghd7 (Fig. 6B; Supplemental Fig. S7B). These results indicate that DTH8 suppresses rice flowering by down-regulating the expression of Ehd1 and Hd3a, and that the expression of DTH8, Hd1,or Ghd7 is independent of each other under LD conditions.. Meanwhile, the differences between DTH8 and Ghd7 were also very obvious. Tiller number in Ghd7 NILs with functional or nonfunctional alleles differed from each other (Xue et al., 2008); those between Asominori and CSSL61 are the same (Fig. 1; Supplemental Tables S2 and S3).

        "question": "early flowering 8 (ef8) selected from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-treated population of indica cultivar 93-11. It showed earlier flowering, less grains per main panicle and slightly darker green leaves than the wildtype 93-11 under natural long-day conditions, but was not significantly different from 93-11 under natural short-day conditions. We isolated the Early Flowering 8 (EF8) gene by map-based cloning. EF8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor, which is localized to the nucleus.Using 452 recessive early-flowering individuals selected from this population, the EF8 gene was mapped to a 38 kb genomic region between markers Fm45 and Fm31 and co-segregated with Fm40 (Fig. 3A). This region contains six open reading frames (ORFs; http://www.gramene.org/; Fig. 2a). All of these genes were sequenced in the ef8 mutant and wild type, and by comparison we found that only the sixth ORF (Loc_Os08g07740) was changed, with a one base deletion at position 323 bp from the start codon in the ef8 mutant; this caused a frame-shift and premature termination of translation (Fig. 3b,c; Supplemental Fig. S2).

        "question": "Two independent floral regulators, Hd1 and Ehd1,control flowering through regulating Hd3a and RFT1 in rice (Izawa 2007; Tsuji et al. 2011). To investigate whether the alteration of expression patterns of the two ‘florigen’ genes by EF8 is mediated by Hd1, Ehd1 or other regulators of Hd1 and Ehd1, such as OsMADS51, OsMADS50 and OsGI (Hayama et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2010), we examined their mRNA levels between wild type and the ef8 mutant under LDs and SDs. Under LDs, to our surprise, no significant differences in the expression of any of these genes were detected between ef8 mutant and wild type (Fig. 5a). Under SDs, the expression pattern of Ehd1 was slightly changed in ef8 mutant compared to wild type, but the expression patterns of other genes were not changed (Fig. 5b). Together, these results indicated that EF8 delayed flowering through altering the rhythmic expression patterns of the ‘florigen’ genes Hd3a and RFT1 independently of Hd1 and Ehd1 under LDs.\nThe ef8 mutant displayed a slightly darker green leaf phenotype and more chlorophyll content compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. S1), which suggested that EF8 may have effect on chlorophyll biogenesis. To test this, we extracted total RNAs from 30-dayold leaves of wild-type and ef8 mutant seedlings under both LDs and SDs, and performed QRT-PCR to examine the expression of genes encoding the enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in rice. Most of these genes were up-regulated to different degrees except chlorophyll synthetase (CHLG)in ef8 mutant compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 6a). For example, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM) and NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A (PORA) were up-regulated more than threefold, and Mg chelatase H subunit (CHLH) and divinyl reductase (DVR) about twofold. However, there were no significant differences in the transcription level of these genes under SDs (Fig. 6b). This result indicated that the higher chlorophyll content was due to higher expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes in the ef8 mutant compared to wild type and EF8 negatively regulated chlorophyll biogenesis under LDs.",

        "question": "We isolated a rice bglu6 mutant (04Z11IG62) with a T-DNA insertion in the sixth intron of the gene (Fig. 1a). Molecular analysis revealed that this T-DNA insertion resulted in no detectable expression ofBGLU6in leaves and roots (Fig. S1a,b). Phenotypic analysis showed that disruption of BGLU6 led to a 46.2% and 66.9% decrease in seedling plant height compared to the WT, at 7 and 14 d post-transplantation, respectively (Figs 1b, S1c,d). The dwarf phenotype was present throughout the entire growth and development stages (Figs 1b, S1c,d). By contrast, no difference was seen in root length of bglu6compared to the WT root length (data not shown). To confirm the role ofBGLU6on plant height, we generated bglu6 RE and OE transgenic rice lines by introducing an Ubiquitin-driven construct harboring BGLU6 (Fig. S2a). The plant height ofBGLU6RE lines were 93.2% that of the WT, indicating a nearly complete restoration of height through expression of BGLU6 in the mutant. BGLU6OE lines had a plant height of 120.5% of the WT (Fig. S2b,c). Likewise, no obvious difference was seen in root length and weight between these genotypes (data not shown). b-glucosidases have been reported to hydrolyze inactive ABAGE, and result in an increase in the endogenous ABA concentration. To investigate if the dwarfism is related to cellular ABA concentration, we examined the endogenous ABA content in leaves of the WT and the bglu6mutant at the seedling stage. ABA content in bglu6was 68.2% that of the WT (Fig. 1c). We also examined leafGA3 content and no difference was seen between the WT and the bglu6mutant (Fig. 1c), suggesting the enzyme is specific for hydrolysis of ABA-GE. Furthermore, spraying 10 lMABA onto bglu6leaves partly restored the plant height ofbglu6(Fig. 1d). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption of BGLU6 affects ABA concentration in leaves, resulting in a dwarfism in the mutant.\nUnder normal conditions, the hydrolysis activity ofABA-GE in the OE-5 line was 22.6% higher than that of the WT (Fig. 2c). After 2 d of drought stress, the hydrolysis activity in the WT and the OE-5 line was increased to 121% and 105% of activity before the treatment (Fig. 2c). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that BGLU6 hydrolyzes ABA-GE to ABA in vitro, and that this activity can be enhanced by drought stress.\nOf the downregulated DEGs, seven were related to stress. Of these, heat shock protein 81-2 (OS09G0482100), SPX domaincontaining protein (OS02G0202200) and embryonic abundant protein (OS05G0349800) were downregulated the most (Table S4). Four DEGs that participate in photosynthesis were identified, with ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain (OS01G0791033), ATP synthase subunit beta, chloroplastic (OS10G0355800) downregulated the most (Table S3). Besides these, we also found that positive regulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis process (GO0010116) was significantly enriched in the DEGs. The expression patterns of these DEGs were confirmed by q-RT-PCR analysis (Fig. S5). Taken together, the above results suggest that disruption of BGLU6 affects chloroplastic oxidative stress and lowers the photosynthesis efficiency, even under normal condition.\nBecause disruption of BGLU6 resulted in a decrease in endogenous ABA concentrations in leaves, and BGLU6 was localized to the chloroplast, we examined the stomatal characteristics of WT, bglu6, RE and OE lines in leaves. Under normal conditions, bglu6had significantly increased stomatal density, at 157.5% that of the WT. The increased stomatal density could be restored by expressing BGLU6 in the mutant, whereas in the OE line the density was not significantly different from that of the WT (Fig. 6a,c).

        "question": "Many of the GH3 genes in Arabidopsis, soybean, and tobacco were found to be differentially expressed in different tissues or in response to exogenous auxin and light stimuli (Tepperman et al. 2001; Hagen and Guilfoyle 2002; Tanaka et al. 2002; Takase et al. 2004). To determine the organ-specific expression pattern of each OsGH3 gene, real-time PCR was performed with total RNA isolated from etiolated shoots, green shoots, roots, flowers, and callus. This analysis revealed that OsGH3 genes are differentially expressed in various tissues/organs (Fig. 6a). The transcription of OsGH3-12 was found to be root-specific and was hardly detectable in other tissues examined (Fig. 6a). However, OsGH3-10 was found to be expressed at very low levels in all the tissues. In contrast, other OsGH3 genes were found to be expressed in almost all the tissues examined but at different levels.Also, significant differences were found in the transcript abundance ofOsGH3 genes in etiolated and green shoots (Fig. 6a)\n",

        "question": "knockout lines (KO-GL10) harbored a frameshift mutation that caused premature termination of translation (Fig. S4A and S4B). These KO-GL10 lines exhibited significantly decreased grain length, grain width, and 1000-grain weight compared to those of the HJX74 wild-type line (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E). In addition, heading date differed significantly between KO-GL10 and HJX74 (Fig. S4C), although we found no detectable differences in plant height, effective tiller numbers, or grain number (Fig. S4DeS4F). We also generated a genetic complementation construct for GL10 overexpression in the NIL-gl10 background via transformation with a p35S-GL10 vector (Fig. S5A and S5B). The GL10 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased grain length and grain weight compared to that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. 2B, 2F, 2G, 2H). Moreover, OE-GL10 grain phenotypes were distinct from that of KO-GL10 plants, with grain length and heading date positively correlating with GL10 expression level. Notably, the heading stage of OE-GL10 was earlier than that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. S5C). In addition, we found no significant differences between OE-GL10 and NIL-gl10 in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant (Fig. S5DeS5F). These results indicate that GL10 was a positive regulator of grain length, grain weight and heading date.\noverexpression of GL10 results in increased grain length and weight and earlier heading date. GL10 regulates grain length by promoting greater longitudinal cell growth in the grain glume. Additionally, GL10 participates in the regulation of gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathway genes in young panicle tissues.

Consistent with the cited reports, glyphosate also reduced the root length of susceptible soybean seedlings . In contrast, glyphosate did not affect the root growth of GR soybeans—an expected result because this cultivar tolerates the herbicide. However, since glyphosate residues and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were found in GR soybean seeds in field’s conditions [22], growth and yield cannot be assumed to be unchanged. Glyphosate reduced the root growth of GR soybeans in greenhouse studies [23], but did not affect soybean growth in field experiments [24].

        "question": "The cultivar Jiaoda 133 is a vegetable soybean, and Williams 82 is a grain soybean; there are several seed phenotypic differences between them. The Jiaoda 133 pods harvested at the R6 stage (stage 6)  and boiled in water for 7 min, tasted sweet, soft and fragrant, whereas those of Williams 82 were hard and neither sweet nor fragrant. For vegetable soybean, the sweet taste is a key trait. To check out which sugar contributed to the sweet taste, we measured the content of four sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose) in fresh seeds at the stage R6. The sucrose content was significantly higher in Jiaoda 133 (2.39 g/100 g) than Williams 82 (1.52 g/100 g). The contents of fructose and glucose were low, with no significant differences between Jiaoda 133 and Williams 82. No maltose was detected . These results suggested that the sweet taste was determined mainly by sucrose content. The pods and fresh grains of Jiaoda 133 were much larger than those of Williams 82 at various developmental stages .

        "question": "Soybean seed protein quality is largely determined by its protein composition. This is especially true in the case of β-subunit of β-conglycinin, a protein that is totally devoid of methionine, an essential amino acid [25]. Since rj1 accumulated very little β-subunit of β-conglycinin, the relative levels of essential amino acids were examined in the total seed protein of Rj1 and rj1 soybeans. Table 1 shows the amino acid composition of Rj1 and rj1 soybean. It is evident that rj1 soybeans, in spite of accumulating lower amounts of β-subunit of β-conglycinin, contained relatively lower amounts of methionine (Table 1). Interestingly, the relative amount of cysteine is higher in rj1 soybeans and its abundance was reduced in the presence of nitrogen, indicating nitrogen may influence the accumulation of proteins that are rich in cysteine",

To corroborate these interactions in planta, native Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD proteins were transiently co-expressed with Gβ and Gγ proteins in tobacco leaves.

In these assays, Gα1quadD also did not show any interaction, whereas the native Gα1 as well as Gα1quadA exhibited strong interactions with all tested combinations of Gβγ proteins .

        "question": "Assuming that cellular respiration is the primary net ATP production source in leaves, the relative proportion of ATP used for protein synthesis and degradation could also be determined using leaf respiration rates of the Arabidopsis rosette (Sew et al., 2013). In leaves that are not growing (e.g., leaf 3 in this study), synthesis of new protein is simply replacing degraded protein and would cost 13% of cellular ATP. By contrast, in leaf 7, which was rapidly growing, synthesis costs reached 38% of total respiratory ATP (Figure 7A). This analysis also showed that the overall ATP cost of protein degradation was ∼4% of respiratory ATP synthesis across all leaf types.",

The common feature of all Arabidopsis BAG proteins is the presence of the BD in the C terminus (Fig. 1C). As in several mammalian BAG proteins, four of the predicted plant BAG family members possess ubiquitin domains in the N terminus, whereas three plant BAG proteins (AtBAG5-7) contain a calmodulin-binding motif near the BD, a novel feature associated with plant BAG family members. As with the structure of bag genes, the domain structure correlates with the predicted cellular localization of Arabidopsis BAG family proteins.

Values of ω = 1 are expected for genes evolving neutrally, whereas ω < 1 is indicative of the action of purifying selection preserving the sequence of the encoded proteins, and ω > 1 in a number of codons is indicative of the action of positive selection (adaptive evolution) driving the fixation of nonsynonymous substitutions. The estimated ω values exhibit a median of 0.128, indicating that these genes evolved under relatively high levels of selective constraint",

Perhaps more surprising is that the association between latitude and freezing tolerance becomes weaker at high latitudes in the native species range. In particular, the trend is stronger for accessions collected from mainland Europe than for accessions collected in Sweden.

        "question": "To examine this further, we considered the relationship between freezing tolerance and 19 climate variables related to seasonal and annual trends in precipitation and temperature (Hijmans et al. 2005). In agreement with the analysis of latitude, the climate variable that best predicts the freezing tolerance of accessions from continental Europe is the mean temperature of the coldest quarter (Fig. 3), with the odds of survivorship lower (Table 2) for accessions native to warm regions (P = 8.13 × 10−24). For Swedish accessions, freezing tolerance is not associated with variables related to the temperature at the site of origin. Instead, we found modest evidence that the odds of survival in Sweden increase with the amount of precipitation in the original habitat. Although snow is widely assumed to protect plants from sub-freezing air temperatures, it also maintains the ambient temperature near the melting point of water, which increases the likelihood of cellular damage due to ice recrystallization (Griffith & Yaish 2004; Gudleifsson 2010).",

        "question": "The results revealed that soil compaction leads to significantly reduced root cap length in wild-type plants, whereas the ZmSPL12 OE lines exhibited only minimal change in this trait. Statistical analysis showed that the number of cell layers within the root cap remained comparable between the genotypes regardless of soil compaction, indicating that compaction might primarily inhibit root cap cell elongation. In particular, the ZmSPL12 OE lines displayed resilience to this compaction effect. Measurements of the root elongation zone showed that soil compaction drastically shortened cell length and broadened cell width in both genotypes. Nevertheless, in the ZmSPL12 OE lines, the cell length within the elongation zone was relatively unaffected, although there was a slight increase in cell width.

Thus, we analyzed the expression levels of MADS26 in different haplotype lines under ethylene treatment. In the roots, the relative expression levels of MADS26 in haplotype II-lines showed a continuous increase across different germination stages under control conditions (Fig. 4c). However, in the roots of haplotype III-lines, its expression abundance reached a peak on the 5 d and then returned to a lower level following the germination process in the control (Fig. 4c). Under the ethylene treatment, however, MADS26 presented a continuously upregulated expression in the roots of both haplotypes (Fig. 4d).

        "question": "The seed germination test is routinely performed to evaluate the range of pollutant concentrations producing plant growth and development inhibition (OECD, 1984, EPA, 1986, APAT, 2002). In this study, maize seeds were exposed to increasing concentrations of chromium, ranging from 2 to 1500 ppm, and after 72 h the number of germinated seeds was counted and root lengths were measured. The percentage germination index (IG) in Fig. 1 was computed from combined data. Reduction of growth parameters was scored for all concentrations tested; at low potassium dichromate concentration (2–20 ppm) the damage was not fatal. An IG of 30% was observed at exposures of 50–100 ppm. Consistent growth inhibition was observed starting from 300 ppm of potassium dichromate (Fig. 1) with the highest inhibition occurring at 1200 ppm. These data indicate that maize is less sensitive to chromium than other plants species such as Trifolium repens (Citterio et al., 2002) or Brassica napus L. (Labra et al., 2004) and suggests that maize is a tolerant species, in agreement with observations from other authors (Mishra et al., 1995, Sharma et al., 2003).

We also identified an ortholog (GRMZM2G007871_P01, No. 1168) of the Arabidopsis J domain ER membrane protein AtERdj2A, which is essential for growth in Arabidopsis as it affects pollen germination (Yamamoto et al., 2008).

        "question": "The rate of glucose utilization by cells is known to be influenced by various environmental factors [25]. One of the outcomes of the current study was to observe the effects of heat stress on carbohydrate metabolism, specifically in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Oxidative PPP is a major source of reducing power and metabolic intermediates for several biosynthetic processes in the cell, and apparent change in the cellular abundance of certain PPP metabolites often severely affects several other metabolism pathways [26]. Analysis of this study revealed that during heat stress, the amount of major glycolysis and PPP metabolites, such as glucose, dihydroxy acetone phosphate and pyruvate, decreased drastically compared to the control treatment (Figure 2 and Figure 3, and Table S2).",

        "question": "The sweeter taste is one of the major differences between grain and vegetable soybeans, which is determined by the higher sucrose content in vegetable soybean. Therefore, we focused on the expressions of genes related to sucrose metabolism and transport. Genes for sweet and waxy corn had been studied, and eight genes of maize endosperm mutant have been used for commercial breeding, including shrunken2 (sh2), brittle1 (bt1), brittle2 (bt2), sugary1 (su1), sugary enhancer1 (se1), amylose extender1 (ae1), dull endosperm1 (du1), and waxy1 (wx1) (Yang and Wang, 2005). The expression of most genes homologous to sh2, bt1 and su1 was higher in Williams 82 than Jiaoda 133 (Fig. 6A), which would contribute to accumulation of sucrose in Jiaoda 133. In contrast, the expression of genes homologous to bt2, se1, ae1, and du1 was lower in Williams 82 than Jiaoda 133 (Fig. 6A), which could increase the amylopectin content and contribute to waxy taste in Jiaoda 133. The expression patterns of two genes homologous to wx1 were opposite in the two genotypes (Fig. 6A), potentially leading to no difference in amylose",

        "question": "To perform genetic analysis of sterile plants, we constructed a sterile population using male-sterile soybean plants found in the field, generated a mixed male-fertile and male-sterile pool in the F2 population, and performed specific length amplified fragment-bulk segregant analysis (SLAF-BSA) sequencing. We calculated the Δ(SNP index) based on the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) index of the male-fertile and male-sterile pool. The Δ(SNP index) graph (Figure 3B) contains a straight line indicating confidence value of 99%. The Δ(SNP index) value should be significantly different from 0 if the genomic region harbors the candidate gene. At the 99% significance level, the only region with a value significantly different from 0, was a region of chromosome 13 spanning 16.15 kb (21,132,960-21,149,112). This finding indicated that the genes controlling fertility are located in this 16.15 kb region (Figure 3A, B); this mapping interval is consistent with the Ms1 gene (20,933,886-23,1150,16) (Figure 3C)",

Native Gα1 protein as well as the variants Gα1S110D and Gα1S315D exhibited slow phosphate release, which significantly increased in the presence of RGS2 protein (Figures 3b and S8). The variant Gα1Q223L showed no Pi release, either by itself or in the presence of RGS protein (Figure 3b). Similarly, negligible Pi release was observed in the protein variants Gα1S50D, Gα1S53D, Gα1quadA and Gα1quadD (Figures 3b and S8). Overall, these data establish that under in vitro conditions, SymRKs phosphorylate Gα proteins in their active site, which causes a complete loss of their GTP binding and GTPase activity",

        "question": "To test the interaction between native and variant Gα1 proteins and Gβ, the full-length proteins were expressed as prey (NUb fusions) and bait (CUb fusions), respectively, in the split-ubiquitin interaction system. In this assay, all native Gβ proteins (Gβ1–Gβ4) interacted with the native Gα1 and with the phospho-deficient Gα1 (Gα1quadA), but intriguingly no interaction was observed with Gα1quadD (Figure 6a). To corroborate these interactions in planta, native Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD proteins were transiently co-expressed with Gβ and Gγ proteins in tobacco leaves. We used two soybean Gβ proteins (Gβ2 and Gβ3), which belong to two different subgroups, and three different Gγ proteins (Gγ1, Gγ5 and Gγ9), representing each of the Gγ subgroups (Roy Choudhury et al., 2011), to test the tripartite interaction of Gβγ with Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD. In these assays, Gα1quadD also did not show any interaction, whereas the native Gα1 as well as Gα1quadA exhibited strong interactions with all tested combinations of Gβγ proteins (Figures 6b and S12). These data imply that the inability of the phosphorylated Gα proteins to interact with Gβγ, thereby making them constitutively available, is most likely to be the critical regulatory aspect of G-protein signaling during nodulation.",
        "answer": "Experiment Objective: To test the interaction between native and variant Gα1 proteins and Gβ proteins using the split-ubiquitin interaction system.\n\nMethodology:\n- Full-length proteins were expressed as prey (NUb fusions) and bait (CUb fusions).\n- Native Gβ proteins (Gβ1–Gβ4) were tested for interaction with native Gα1, phospho-deficient Gα1 (Gα1quadA), and phosphorylated Gα1 (Gα1quadD).\n\nKey Findings:\n- All native Gβ proteins interacted with native Gα1 and Gα1quadA.\n- No interaction was observed with Gα1quadD in the split-ubiquitin system.\n- In planta assays confirmed these results: native Gα1 and Gα1quadA showed strong interactions with various Gβγ protein combinations, while Gα1quadD did not.\n\nAdditional Details:\n- In planta assays were conducted by transiently co-expressing native Gα1, Gα1quadA, or Gα1quadD with Gβ and Gγ proteins in tobacco leaves.\n- Soybean Gβ proteins (Gβ2 and Gβ3) and Gγ proteins (Gγ1, Gγ5, and Gγ9) were used to test interactions.\n\nConclusion:\n- The inability of phosphorylated Gα proteins (like Gα1quadD) to interact with Gβγ suggests a critical regulatory mechanism in G-protein signaling during nodulation.",

        "question": "From the diurnal variation of the photosynthetic rate of different soybean varieties under cloudy conditions (Figure 4B), it can be seen that, influenced by the cloudy weather, the high-yield variety Changnong 39 exhibits a brief midday photosynthetic rest phenomenon. The maximum photosynthetic rate of the population occurs between 10:00 and 11:00. For the conventional varieties Jiyu 441 and Changnong 35, the midday photosynthetic rest phenomenon is not obvious, showing a single peak curve. Among them, the maximum photosynthetic rate of the Jiyu 441 population occurs earlier than that of Changnong 39.",

        "question": "Field tests of these plant lines inBeijing in 2018 revealed that OsDREB1C overexpression led to increases in grain yield per plant of 45.1 to 67.6% and in yield per plot of 41.3 to 68.3% compared with wild-type (WT) plants (Fig. 1C). Conversely, OsDREB1C KO resulted in yield decreases (from 16.1 to 29.1% in yield per plant and 13.8 to 27.8% in yield per plot) compared with the WT (Fig. 1, D and E, and table S1). A detailed phenotypic analysis showed that the higher yield of the OsDREB1C-OE lines was mainly attributable to an enhanced grain number per panicle and an increased 1000-grain weight (Fig. 1F and fig. S3C), traits apparently resulting from increased secondary branch number and grain length, width, thickness, and density (fig. S3, A and B and D to K, respectively). The OsDREB1C-OE plants exhibited higher grain yield but reduced strawweight compared withWT plants (Fig. 1G), thus leading to an increased harvest index (the ratio of grain yield to aboveground biomass; Fig. 1H) and raising the possibility that OsDREB1C controls resource allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues. The harvest index of OsDREB1C-OE plants was increased by 40.3 to 55.7%, whereas it was decreased by 22.4 to 33.7% in OsDREB1C-KO plants (table S1). In addition, key grain quality traits were enhanced in OsDREB1C-OE plants, suggesting that yield improvement does not entail a quality penalty (table S2).Leaves of\nOsDREB1C-OE plants contained higher levels\nof photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and\ncarotenoids) compared with WT plants, where-\nas pigment levels were reduced in OsDREB1C-\nKO plants (fig. S7A). Analysis ofleafmesophyll\ncells revealed that both chloroplast number\nand sizewere increased in OsDREB1C-OE plants\n(fig.S7, Band C).. Analysis of carbon and nitrogen distribution showed that the OsDREB1C-OE plants accumulated more carbon and nitrogen in the grains, but less in their mature leaves, without substantial alterations in the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (Fig. 3H and fig. S11).",
        "answer": "Field tests in Beijing in 2018 showed that overexpression of OsDREB1C in plant lines led to significant increases in grain yield per plant and per plot, while knockout of OsDREB1C resulted in yield decreases. The higher yield was attributed to an enhanced grain number per panicle and increased 1000-grain weight, due to increased secondary branch number and grain dimensions.

        "question": "We field-tested 2 or 3 T1 families randomly selected from T0 plants. Compared with the negative segregants, elevated DEP1 accumulation increased the grain length by 6.85–9.58% with a normal plant stature. However, plants overexpressing dep1 showed very similar phenotype to DEP1Ri plants, both of which reduced grain length by ~4.5%, together with dwarf stature and erect panicles (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). The expression level of endogenous DEP1 in dep1OE was not reduced (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Thus dep1 showed a dominant-negative effect over DEP1 in regulating grain size rather than cosuppression of the two genes. In contrast to DEP1OE, GS3-1OE showed an average 9.07% reduction in grain length together with reduced plant stature, very similar to the phenotype of dep1OE (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). GS3-4OE produced even smaller plants and grain size with an average 19.10% reduction of grain length relative to the negative segregant, while GS3-1Ri resulted in an average 5.78% increase of grain length. These results were similar to those of Mao et al39.It was shown that knocking out DEP1 in the GS3-1OE or GS3-4OE background did not further reduce the gain size of GS3-1OE or GS3-4OE (Supplementary Fig. 2d). We also crossed DEP1OE with GS3-1Ri and GS3-1OE transgenic plants. Further increased grain length was observed when overexpressing DEP1 in GS3-1Ri background, whereas the DEP1OE/GS3-1OE hybrid showed the GS3-1OE phenotype of short grain (Supplementary Fig. 2e).GS3 in grain size regulation was to repress the effects of DEP1 and GGC2 on increasing grain size.",

        "question": "Among them, Bg1-D has the most obviously increased grain size (Fig. 1A). Compared with WT (Nipponbare, Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), the 1,000-grain weight of Bg1-D has increased about 33.8%, with the grain length and grain width increased about 15.2% and 17.0%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Observation of spikelet hull by scanning electron microscopy showed that the epidermis cells of both palea and lemma in Bg1-D are much longer than that of the WT (Fig. S1). Careful examination of the hull cross-section before flowering revealed significant increases of both number and area of the parenchyma cells in the Bg1-D mutant (Fig. 1 C and D). Consistent with this, a number of genes associated with cell cycle and cell expansion were up-regulated in the panicles of the Bg1-D mutant (Fig. S2). Despite the greatly enlarged grain size, Bg1-D also exhibits enhanced growth of other tissues at both the vegetative and reproductive stages (Fig. 1E and Fig. S3). One-week-old seedlings of the Bg1-D mutant have obviously increased length of leaf and root compared with WT (Fig. S3 A–D). When plants enter reproductive stage, the leaves of Bg1-D are longer and wider than those of the WT plants, and the Bg1-D also has increased plant height (Fig. 1E, Fig. S3E, and Table S1). In addition, the Bg1-D panicles are much larger than those of the WT (Fig. S3 F and G).we overexpressed BG1 cDNA under the control of the rice ACTIN1 promoter in WT and found that the BG1overexpressing plants (BG1-OE) showed obviously increased grain size and other phenotypes, such as enhanced plant height, longer leaves, and larger panicles, which resemble the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes (Fig. 2C and Fig. S6 A and B). Importantly, severity of the phenotypes was apparently correlated with the BG1 expression level; that is, plants with higher BG1 expression have bigger grain size as well as increased 1,000-grain weight (Fig. 2 D–G), demonstrating that activation of BG1 is the cause for the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes.",
        "answer": "The Bg1-D variant of Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica shows significantly increased grain size, with a 33.8% increase in 1,000-grain weight, and 15.2% and 17.0% increases in grain length and width respectively. The variant also exhibits longer epidermis cells and increased parenchyma cells in the hull, and up-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle and expansion. Despite the enlarged grain size, Bg1-D also shows enhanced growth in other tissues at both vegetative and reproductive stages, with increased leaf and root length, plant height, and larger panicles. Overexpression of BG1 cDNA in wild type plants resulted in similar phenotypes, with severity correlating with BG1 expression level, indicating that BG1 activation is responsible for the Bg1-D mutant phenotypes.",

        "question": "Similarly, highly hydrolyzed amyloplasts as in WT tubes are observed in DJ5 tubes (Figure S6e,g), and lowly hydrolyzed amyloplasts as in xt6 tubes are also found in sg17 tubes (Figure S6f,h). These suggest that starch hydrolysis in xt6 PTs is much slower than that in WT PTs, which implies that starch hydrolysis may be inhibited in xt6 PTs.the a-amylase extracted from WT was treated with the methanol extract of WT and xt6 pollen, respectively, and it was found that the methanol extract of xt6 pollen significantly inhibited the a-amylase activity, and the degree of inhibition was higher than that of the methanol extract of WT pollens (Figure 6d), suggesting that there may be other a-amylase activity inhibitors besides flavonoids in the methanol extract of xt6 mutant pollen. Since flavonoids have been greatly reduced in the xt6 mutant pollen (Figure 4c), amounts of other inhibitors should be increased to make the effect of the inhibitor in the xt6 mutant greater than that of WT. Considering that triterpenoids were previously reported to be inhibitors of a-amylase (Ali et al., 2006), and that triterpenoids were significantly accumulated in the xt6 mutant pollen (Figure 4e), we further compared the inhibitory effects of flavonols (Chalcone, quercetin and kaempferol) and three commonly used triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupeol) on a-amylase. Our experiments showed that three triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupinol) could significantly inhibit the activity of a-amylase, and their inhibitory effect was even stronger than that of flavonols (Figure 6e). These data indicate that a-amylase activity is significantly reduced by mutation of OsCHS1, possibly due to the accumulation of triterpenoid inhibitors in the xt6 mutation.",
        "answer": "The study suggests that starch hydrolysis in xt6 PTs is slower than in WT PTs, possibly due to inhibition. The methanol extract of xt6 pollen significantly inhibited a-amylase activity more than the extract of WT pollen, indicating the presence of other inhibitors besides flavonoids. Despite the reduction of flavonoids in xt6 mutant pollen, the inhibitory effect is greater, suggesting an increase in other inhibitors. Triterpenoids, which were found to be significantly accumulated in the xt6 mutant pollen, were identified as potential inhibitors of a-amylase. The inhibitory effect of three triterpenoids was stronger than that of flavonols, indicating that a-amylase activity might be reduced in the xt6 mutation due to the accumulation of triterpenoid inhibitors.",

        "question": "Compared with the wild type, plant height of the afd1 mutant reduced by 27%, 20% and 14% at the seedling stage, tillering stage and maturation stage, respectively (Figures 1A–D, S1). When rice plants reach maturity, the 2nd, 3rd,4th and 5th internodes showed no differences, but the 1st internode was distinctly shorter in the afd1 mutant (Figure 1D, E).Taken together, we concluded that the lodicule was prone to transformation of the lodicule into the hull and has acquired the hull identity in the afd1 mutant, and that the hull-like lodicules and the thickened hulls confined the stamens in the space bounded by the hulls and for better pollination. Additionally, 9% of afd1 florets generated awns at the top of the lemmas and the epidermal cells of awns had lots of trichomes, and no awns were formed in the florets of the wild type (Figures S3, S4A).These results suggested that the low setting percentage in the afd1 mutant was due to both inefficient pollination (i.e. the thicker hulls limited the pollination in the afd1 mutant) and defective pollen grains.eantime, the awn was observed at the top of the afd1 lemma primordium but no awn was found in the wild type (Figure 6D, H). These results suggested that AFD1 affected the enlargement of the hulls and restrained the formation of the awns at later stages, but seemed not to influence floral organ initiation.",
        "answer": "The afd1 mutant of a plant showed a reduction in height at various stages compared to the wild type. The first internode was notably shorter in the mutant at maturity, while other internodes showed no difference. The afd1 mutant also showed a transformation of the lodicule into the hull, leading to confined stamens and affected pollination. Additionally, 9% of afd1 florets formed awns with trichomes, unlike the wild type. The low setting percentage in the afd1 mutant was due to inefficient pollination and defective pollen grains. The AFD1 mutation also affected the enlargement of the hulls and restrained the formation of awns at later stages, but didn't influence floral organ initiation.",

The gOsSPL14 transgenic lines had reduced tillers, stronger culms and increased panicle branches and grain yield (Supplementary Fig. 4). In contrast, the OsSPL14 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants in the Ri22 background generated more tillers and showed a marked reduction in plant height, diameter of culms, panicle branches and grain number (Supplementary Fig. 5).

        "question": "esulting knockout lines (KO-GL10) harbored a frameshift mutation that caused premature termination of translation (Fig. S4A and S4B). These KO-GL10 lines exhibited significantly decreased grain length, grain width, and 1000-grain weight compared to those of the HJX74 wild-type line (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E). In addition, heading date differed significantly between KO-GL10 and HJX74 (Fig. S4C), although we found no detectable differences in plant height, effective tiller numbers, or grain number (Fig. S4DeS4F). We also generated a genetic complementation construct for GL10 overexpression in the NIL-gl10 background via transformation with a p35S-GL10 vector (Fig. S5A and S5B). The GL10 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased grain length and grain weight compared to that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. 2B, 2F, 2G, 2H). Moreover, OE-GL10 grain phenotypes were distinct from that of KO-GL10 plants, with grain length and heading date positively correlating with GL10 expression level. Notably, the heading stage of OE-GL10 was earlier than that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. S5C). In addition, we found no significant differences between OE-GL10 and NIL-gl10 in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant (Fig. S5DeS5F). These results indicate that GL10 was a positive regulator of grain length, grain weight and heading date.In addition, the SEM assays showed that HJX74 plants exhibited greater longitudinal grain length than plants from either KO-GL10 line (Fig. S6A, S6C, S6D), while the grain length of the KO-GL10 plants was similar to that of NIL-gl10 plants. We also observed that the epidermal cell sizes in spikelet hulls of the OEGL10 plants were significantly greater than in those of NIL-gl10 plants (Fig. S6B, S6E, S6F). These results indicate that GL10 controls grain length by positively influencing the length of epidermal cells in the spikelet hull.",

The overexpression of GL10 resulted in increased grain length and weight, and an earlier heading stage. The grain length and heading date correlated positively with GL10 expression level. There were no significant differences in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant.

        "question": "The mutant osfie1 produced smaller seeds and displayed reduced dormancy, indicating that OsFIE1 predominantly functions in late seed development. Ectopic expression of OsFIE1, but not OsFIE2, was deleterious to vegetative growth in a dose-dependent manner. The newly evolved N-terminal tail of OsFIE1 was probably not the cause of the adverse effects on vegetative growth. The CRISPR/Cas9-derived mutant osfie2 exhibited impaired cellularization of the endosperm, which suggested that OsFIE2 is indispensable for early seed development as a positive regulator of cellularization. Autonomous endosperm was observed in both OsFIE2+ and osfie1/OsFIE2+ but at a very low frequency. Although OsFIE1-PRC2 exhibited H3K27me3 methyltransferase ability in plants, OsFIE1-PRC2 is likely to be less important for development in rice than is OsFIE2-PRC2.The expression of OsFIE1 in the endosperm in independent transgenic lines was significantly increased, whereas the expression of OsFIE2 was not altered in the transgenic plants (Figure 2b). Unlike the Ubi::OsFIE1 plants, the GT1::OsFIE1 lines showed vegetative development similar to that of the WT (Figure 2c). However, all three independent GT1:: OsFIE1 transgenic lines analyzed produced seeds significantly smaller than the WT seeds (Figure 2a and Figure S6). The 1000-grain weight of GT1::OsFIE1 was reduced to 86–88% of the WT value (Figure S6d). The results unambiguously indicated that overexpression of OsFIE1 could directly affect seed development.The osfie1 mutant produced smaller seeds and showed increased frequency of pre-harvest sprouting relative to the WT (Figure 3), suggesting that OsFIE1 plays roles in late seed development (Figure S13).",
        "answer": "The mutant osfie1 produces smaller seeds and shows reduced dormancy, indicating OsFIE1's role in late seed development. Overexpression of OsFIE1 negatively impacts vegetative growth, but its N-terminal tail doesn't cause adverse effects. The mutant osfie2 shows impaired endosperm cellularization, suggesting OsFIE2's essential role in early seed development. Autonomous endosperm is rarely observed in both OsFIE2+ and osfie1/OsFIE2+. OsFIE1-PRC2 exhibits H3K27me3 methyltransferase ability but is less important for rice development than OsFIE2-PRC2. Overexpression of OsFIE1 in transgenic lines increases its expression in the endosperm but doesn't alter OsFIE2's expression. GT1::OsFIE1 lines show normal vegetative development but produce smaller seeds, reducing the 1000-grain weight to 86–88% of the wild type.

        "question": "Wax biosynthesis begins with de novo-synthesized C16 and C18 fatty acids within the leucoplasts. C16 and C18 fatty acids are then elongated to VLCFAs by the fatty acid elongase (FAE) complex, consisting of b-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), b-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, b-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydratase, and enoylCoA reductase, on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). VLCFA elongation involves a four-step reaction cycle: First, the condensation of C16 and C18 acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA is catalyzed by KCS, yielding b-ketoacylCoA; second, the reduction of b-ketoacyl-CoA is catalyzed by b-ketoacyl-CoA reductase; third, the resulting b-hydroxy acyl-CoA is dehydrated by b-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydratase; and fourth, the enoyl acylCoA is reduced by enoyl-CoA reductase. Each cycle results in an acyl-CoA with a two-carbon extension (Kunst and Samuels, 2009). The generated VLCFACoAs are then thiolysed to yield free fatty acids or are used further in an acyl reduction (alcoholforming) pathway, yielding primary alcohols, or a decarbonylation (alkane-forming) pathway, yielding aldehydes and alkanes (Kunst and Samuels, 2003; Samuels et al., 2008)",

        "question": "hirteen OsDT11-overexpressing lines were obtained, and three of them (pU1301::OsDT11-1,3, and 4) were selected for determination of the transcript level. When the plants were 15 days old, both the overexpressing and wild-type lines were deprived of water for 17 days. After the treatment, most of the wild-type plants withered, while the overexpressing lines exhibited less wilting compared with the control plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). Water was then supplied for 7 days, resulting in the recovery of all of the transgenic lines but not the wild-type plants (Fig. 4a, panel RW). OsDT11 expression in the transgenic plants was significantly correlated with water loss (r = −0.855, Fig. 4b, c). To further confirm the function of OsDT11 in drought tolerance, the knockdown transgenic lines were also examined under drought stress conditions. The transgenic plants were found to be more sensitive to drought stress than the wildtype plants (Fig. 4a, panel D17). After rewatering for 7 days, neither the transgenic nor the wild-type lines recovered (Fig. 4a, panel RW). The water loss of the wild-type plants was approximately 10 % lower than that of the suppressed plants. Additionally, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the OsDT11 expression level in the knockdown lines was associated with water loss (r = −0.767, Fig. 4b, c). These results indicate that the overexpression of OsDT11 improves the tolerance to drought stress in rice. To further evaluate the physiological mechanism by which OsDT11 enables the plant to retain water, the stomata and wax on the leaf surface of wild-type and transgenic plants were visualized by ESEM. It was found that the stomatal size was smaller on the leaf surface of wildtype plants under drought stress conditions, compared with the wild-type plants under normal condition (Fig. 5a, b). However, there was no obvious difference between the overexpressing lines and wild-type plants under normal conditions, and the overexpression lines after drought treatment (Fig. 5c, d). Similar results were observed for the calculated stomatal density. Only the drought-stressed wild-type plants presented as higher stomatal density on the leaves than the others three samples (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, there was no obvious difference between the wax distribution of the wild-type and transgenic lines under normal conditions, and a reduction in wax content was only observed for wild-type lines after drought treatment (Fig. S3). These results indicate that OsDT11 overexpression may improve water retention by modulating stomatal density.To test whether ABA biosynthesis was affected in the transgenic plants, the endogenous ABA levels in the overexpressing and wild-type lines were measured under normal conditions and were found to be 16.25 ng g−1FW on average in the wild-type seedlings, while they were increased to 61.56, 35.91, and 24.96 ng g−1FW in the three different pU1301::OsDT11 lines, respectively (Fig. 8). These findings suggested that the ABA concentration was highly increased in the overexpressing seedlings, demonstrating that ABA biosynthesis was affected in the OsDT11 transgenic plants.",

The overexpression of OsDT11 was significantly correlated with reduced water loss. Knockdown transgenic lines were more sensitive to drought and did not recover after rewatering.

        "question": "To confirm that LOC_Os06g03240 confers BPH resistance, we transformed a susceptible indica variety, Kasalath (Ka), with the cDNA sequence of the Ptb33 Bph32 gene. Six independent transgenic events were detected using genomic southern blotting. Among them, N65-71-1-8 contains a single-copy of Bph32 and N65-2-5-2-6 contains a double-copy. Their T2:3 plants were used to measure the levels of resistance of Bph32. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, upon infestation with BPH at the seedling stage, all the wild-type control (Kasalath and TN1) and empty-vector transgenic plants died, whereas the transgenic rice plants expressing the Ptb33 Bph32 gene survived (Fig. 2a,b and c). When infected at the maturing stage, the wild-type plants exhibited leaf wilting, a decrease in seed and grain plumpness, and even death of the whole plant, whereas the Bph32 transgenic plants were all healthy (Fig. 2d). Plants have evolved three defence mechanisms for responding to insect attack: antixenosis repels or disturbs insect settling, thereby reducing colonization or oviposition; antibiosis reduces insect feeding, survival or growth rate; and tolerance helps a crop to maintain high quality and yield after insect infestation48. To explore how Bph32 is involved in plant resistance to BPH, we conducted assays to compare nymph survival and honeydew excretion between the resistant Bph32 transgenic and susceptible wild-type plants (Table S3 and Fig. 2e and f). In the nymph survival test, the number of nymphs steadily decreased on the transgenic plants but began to stabilize 8 days after infestation on the wild-type controls (Fig. 2e). Honeydew excretion in the honeydew area of the transgenic plants was significantly lower than that of the wild-type controls or TN1 plants. However, the difference in honeydew excretion between the transgenic plants and the Ptb33 plants was insignificant (Fig. 2f). These results demonstrate that BPH feeding was inhibited on the resistant Bph32 transgenic plants and suggest that Bph32 conferred an antibiosis resistance that reduced BPH feeding and survival.",
        "answer": "The LOC_Os06g03240 gene, also known as Bph32, was found to confer resistance to the Brown Planthopper (BPH) in rice plants. This was confirmed through experiments on the susceptible indica variety, Kasalath (Ka), which was transformed with the Bph32 gene. Transgenic rice plants expressing Bph32 survived BPH infestation at both seedling and maturing stages, while control and empty-vector transgenic plants did not. The Bph32 gene appears to confer an antibiosis resistance, reducing BPH feeding and survival, as evidenced by lower nymph survival and honeydew excretion in transgenic plants compared to wild-type controls.",

        "question": "To analyze the salt-tolerant phenotypes of SR86 and Nipponbare (Nip), SR86 and Nip rice were treated with different concentrations of salt. In the 150 mM NaCl treatment, SR86 plants showed a survival rate of 70%, while Nip showed no survival (Fig. 1A–D). To mine the salt tolerance-related genes in SR86, 30 extremely salt-tolerant and 30 extremely salt-sensitive plants were selected from the F(2) progeny of the SR86 × Nip cross, and mixed bulks were generated. BSA-seq analysis revealed salt tolerance related candidate region on chromosome 4, chromosome 8 and chromosome 12 (Fig. 1E). Based on the threshold line, chromosome 4 was judged to have the relevant to the target trait (Fig. 1E). Functional annotation analysis revealed that this region contained a putative salt stress-related gene, LOC_Os04g03320. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis suggested that the expression level of LOC_Os04g03320 was significantly higher in SR86 than that in Nip in the 150 mM NaCl treatment (Fig. 1F). Therefore, we selected LOC_Os04g03320 as the candidate salt tolerance-related gene. Because the protein encoded by this gene was a JRLs protein, we named this gene as OsJRL45.",

        "question": "The ability of seeds to germinate under high salinity conditions is an important indicator of salt tolerance [53]. Germination experiments were performed using the seeds of WT plants, Osjrl45 mutant lines (KO1 and KO2), and OsJRL45-OE lines (OE1 and OE2) under control (0 mM NaCl) and salt treatments (100 and 200 mM NaCl) (Fig. 4C–E). Under normal conditions, the WT, KO1, KO2, OE1, and OE2 genotypes showed no difference in the seed germination rate and seedling growth (Fig. 4C). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, compared with the WT, the shoot and root lengths of knockout mutants seedlings were significantly reduced, while those of overexpression lines seedlings were significantly increased (Fig. 4C-E). Under 200 mM NaCl stress, the KO1 and KO2 lines showed seed germination but almost no seedling growth (Fig. 4C-E).Next, we analyzed the salt tolerance of WT and all knockout and overexpressed transgenic rice at the seedling period. Under normal conditions, the WT, KO1, KO2, OE1, and OE2 genotypes showed no difference (Fig. 5A). Under salt stress, the knockout plants indicated severe wilting, while the overexpressed plants grew better than WT plants (Fig. 5A). The chlorophyll content, fresh weights and dry weights of KO1 and KO2 plants were significantly lower after treatment than before treatment, while the chlorophyll contents of OE1 and OE2 plants were lower and their fresh weights and dry weights were significantly higher (Fig. 5C-E). The survival rates (Fig. 5B), chlorophyll contents (Fig. 5C), fresh weights (Fig. 5D), and dry weights (Fig. 5E) of knockout plants seedlings were significantly lower than those of the WT plants, while those of overexpressed transgenic rice seedlings were higher under salinity stress treatments. Collectively, these results suggest that OsJRL45 positively regulates salt tolerance at the germination and seedling stages.To elucidate its biological function, the OsJRL45 gene isolated from SR86 was transformed into the salt-sensitive indica cultivar L6-23. The promoter of OsJRL45 was cloned into the pCAMBIA1300 vector, and the resultant construct was transformed into L6-23 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to create transgenic rice (named Lh). The L6-23 plants suggested severe wilting, while the Lh plants grew better than the L6-23 rice under salt stress (Fig. 7A). RT-qPCR results indicated that the expression level of OsJRL45 was significantly higher in Lh transgenic rice than in L6-23 plants (Fig. 7B). Compared with the L6-23 plants, the survival rate (Fig. 7C) and chlorophyll content (Fig. 7D) of Lh plants were significantly higher under salt stress conditions.",
        "answer": "Experiments on seed germination under high salinity conditions found that the OsJRL45 gene positively regulates salt tolerance in rice at the germination and seedling stages. Under normal conditions, there was no difference in germination rate and seedling growth between wild-type (WT) plants and Osjrl45 mutant and overexpression lines. However, under salt stress, knockout mutants showed reduced shoot and root lengths and severe wilting, while overexpression lines showed increased lengths and better growth. The gene was then isolated and transformed into a salt-sensitive rice cultivar, resulting in significantly higher survival rates and chlorophyll content under salt stress conditions.",

However, three OsHAP3 genes were highly expressed in all tested organs at different developmental stages. One gene (Loc_OS02g49410) showed preferential expression in the panicle and endosperm (Supplemental Figure 1). These findings indicated that different members of the OsHAP3 family have different functions in the rice lifecycle. To check the spatio-temporal expression of Ghd8 under LD conditions, RNA in situ hybridization was performed with roots, young leaves, stems, and young panicles of NILHR5. Ghd8 was highly expressed in the phloem of leaves, the vascular system of the stem, and especially in cells of the inflorescence meristem. The inflorescence meristem formed bracts and inflorescence branches (Itoh et al., 2005), which probably determined panicle size (Supplemental Figure 2).",

        "question": "To test this prediction, we introduced both Ghd8 alleles of 93–11 (Ghd8 (93–11)) and Nipponbare (Ghd8(Nip)) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into NILZS, which has a small panicle, short stature, and early heading compared to NILHR5. The T1 families of the T0 transformants containing a single-copy of the Ghd8 (93–11) and (Ghd8 (Nip)) alleles were analyzed for their phenotypic effects under natural LD conditions (13–14-h day length). The positive T1 plants showed significantly more grains, delayed heading and taller culms compared to the transgenic negative plants (Figure 1). The negative Ghd8 transgenic plants (NILZS–) showed a performance similar to their recipient line NILZS in heading date, grain yield, grains per panicle, and plant height (Table 1). On average, a positive T1 plant (NIL93–11+/NILNip+) resulted in increases above 60% in grain yield per plant and grains per panicle compared to the recipient NILZS and the negative T1 plant (NILZS–) (Figure 1). The NILNip+ plant showed a performance similar to that of the NIL carrying the HR5 homozygotes (NILHR5) in grain yield, grains per panicle, and plant height; however, the transformants with the Ghd8 (93–11) allele were delayed in flowering by 9 d, thus indicating the strong effect of the 93–11 allele on heading date (Table 1). In summary, the complementary test confirmed that the candidate gene was in fact Ghd8.When compared to ZS97, ZS97Nip flowered earlier and later under SD and LD conditions, respectively (Table 2). That is to say, the Ghd8 allele of Nipponbare promoted flowering under SD conditions and inhibited flowering under LD conditions in ZS97. We also compared the diurnal expression of OsMADS51 (Kim et al., 2008) under SD conditions, that of OsMADS50 under LD conditions and that of OsGI, Hd1, Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 under both conditions between positive and negative transgenic plants (ZS97Nip+ and ZS97Nip–). There was no difference in diurnal expression for OsGI, OsMADS51, OsMADS50, and Hd1, but a distinct difference was observed for Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 between ZS97Nip+ and ZS97Nip– (Figure 3A and 3B).

Consistent with the GUS staining data, a quantitative real-time PCR analysis also showed that TAC4 was ubiquitously expressed in various rice organs, with the most abundant expression occurring in the young panicle, lamina joint, leaf sheath pulvinus and internode (Figure 3k). TAC4 mRNA in situ hybridization showed that a high TAC4 transcript abundance could be detected in the axillary and shoot apical meristem at the tillering stage (Figure 3l–o). RNA-sequencing data showed TAC4 transcripts in both the lower and upper sides of tiller bases, and the expression levels were similar (Figure S5).

        "question": "The function of LOC_Os02g25230 was further confirmed by genetic transformation. All the transgenic plants overexpressing the full-length coding sequence of LOC_Os02g25230 (derived from IL55) in the tac4-mutant background displayed the small tiller angle phenotype, similar to IL55 (Figure 2b–e). Using RNA interference (RNAi), we generated LOC_Os02g25230 knockdown plants in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare background. The RNAi transgenic plants exhibited greater tiller angles compared with control plants, indicating that the decreased expression of LOC_Os02g25230 significantly increased tiller angle (Figure 2f–h). Therefore, we concluded that LOC_Os02g25230 corresponds to the TAC4 gene and that the expression level of TAC4 was negatively correlated with tiller angle.the introgression line IL55 harbouring the tac1 allele (Aida et al., 1997), which displays an extremely compact tiller angle in the indica rice variety IR24 background, was mutagenized with ethyl methane sulphonate to generate a mutant library for screening plants with large tiller angles. One such mutant, tac4, was identified. During both the vegetative and reproductive stages, tac4 always exhibited a greater tiller angle than IL55 (Figure 1a and b, and Figure S1), and at the heading stage, the tiller angle was ~13.2° in the tac4 mutant, while it was only ~5.2° in the IL55 (Figure 1c and d). The heights of tac4 plants were reduced ~20% compared with those of IL55 and mainly resulted from the shortened uppermost internode (Figure S2a–c). Observations of longitudinal sections of the uppermost internode revealed that cell lengths were significantly decreased in tac4, indicating that the decreased cell elongation could be the main cause of the reduced tac4 plant height (Figure S2d). We found that the panicle length was shorter, and the primary and secondary branches and the grain number per panicle were significantly reduced, compared with IL55 (Table S1). The grain length of tac4 was shorter than that of IL55, and the mean 1000-grain weight was less (Figure S3). These observations suggest that TAC4 is pleiotropic, regulating multiple important agronomic traits.",
        "answer": "The function of the gene LOC_Os02g25230, also known as TAC4, was confirmed through genetic transformation. When overexpressed in transgenic plants, it resulted in a small tiller angle phenotype, similar to IL55. Conversely, when its expression was decreased through RNA interference, the tiller angle increased. This indicates that TAC4 expression is negatively correlated with tiller angle. Additionally, the tac4 mutant exhibited a greater tiller angle, reduced plant height due to decreased cell elongation, and shorter panicle length, with fewer branches and grains per panicle compared to IL55. The study suggests that TAC4 is pleiotropic, regulating multiple important agronomic traits.",

        "question": "we used the CRISPR/ Cas9 system to knock out LOC_Os01g20110 in the wildtype GP50 (Fig. 6a). Two homozygous positive transgenic plants were identified among gene-edited lines of the ­T0 generation, and seedlings of these independent transgenic lines displayed an obvious white-striped leaf phenotype consistent with that of the osal50 mutant (Fig. 6b, c). Specifically, 3-bp and 11-bp deletions were detected at the target site of LOC_Os01g20110 in the two transgenic lines, respectively (Fig. 6d). These deletions resulted in frameshift mutations. Thus, we verified that LOC_Os01g20110 was the candidate OsAL50 gene, with mutations in the associated promoter region potentially contributing to the observed albino phenotype in osal50 mutant plants.All\nof these genes were significantly down-regulated in osal50mutant leaves compared with wild-type leaves at the four-leaf stage (Fig. 8a), with consistent expression patterns oftranscriptional suppression in young panicles, includingglumes and branches, of osal50 at the heading stage, except for the chloroplast development-related FtsZ, OsRPOB, and V3 genes (Fig. 8c, d). Moreover, the expression levels of all\nof these genes were markedly increased in osal50 mutant leaves at the seven-leaf stage (when the leaves turn green)ompared with those at the four-leaf stage (Fig. 8b), withOsCHLI, OsCHLD, OsDVR, OsPSAA, OsPSBA, OsRBCL,OsPOLP, and V2 expression restored to wild-type levels andOsHEMA1, OsCAB1R, OsPETA, OsPETB, and OsRBCSexpression levels in the osal50 mutant even higher thanthose in the wild type at the seven-leaf stage (Fig. 8b).

        "answer": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to knock out the LOC_Os01g20110 gene in the wildtype GP50, resulting in two transgenic plants with a white-striped leaf phenotype similar to the osal50 mutant. This was due to 3-bp and 11-bp deletions at the target site, causing frameshift mutations. This confirmed LOC_Os01g20110 as the candidate OsAL50 gene, with mutations in its promoter region potentially causing the albino phenotype in osal50 mutants. The study also found significant down-regulation of certain genes in osal50 mutant leaves compared to wild-type leaves, indicating that OsAL50 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression related to chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast development, and photosynthesis in rice.",

        "question": "it was used for gen-\nerating T-DNA insertion knockout (ossiz2 in Dongjin [DJ] background) and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated\nknockdown (Ri1-3 in Nipponbare [NB] background) mutants (Supplemental Fig. S1). The insertion of the T-DNA\nwas downstream of the OsSIZ2 translational start site and in the exon 5 (Supplemental Fig. S1a). Two-round PCR\nwas employed for screening randomly selected 11 putative T-DNA insertion mutants for identifying homozygous\nossiz2 knockout mutants by using (i) T-DNA right border-specific primer P and OsSIZ2-specific primer R1 and(ii) OsSIZ2-specific primers (F1 and R1) flanking the T-DNA insertion site (Supplemental Fig. S1a,b). The anal-ysis revealed that ~55% of them (lines 3 to 8 marked with red boxes) are homozygous and are hereafter referred to as ossiz2 (Supplemental Fig. S1b). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out by using F2 and R2 primers for validating the lack of OsSIZ2 transcripts in ossiz2 mutants (lines 3, 5, 7 and 8; Supplemental Fig. S1c). Further,qRT-PCR was employed by using OsSIZ2-specific primers for determining the relative expression levels of OsSIZ2\nin wild-types (NB and DJ) and the mutants (Ri1-3 and ossiz2) (Supplemental Fig. S1d). The relative expression levels of OsSIZ2 were significantly reduced (~35–58%) in Ri1-3 and undetected in ossiz2 compared with their cor-responding wild-type. The results confirmed that Ri1-3 and ossiz2 are knockdown and knockout mutants, respec-tively of OsSIZ2. Southern blot analysis confirmed a single T-DNA insertion in ossiz2 (Supplemental Fig. S1e).The present study thus suggested a pivotal role of OsSIZ2 in exerting positive regulatory influences on the developmental responses of different morphometric traits during vegetative and reproductive growth phases. Comparative analyses of these traits in ossiz2 with ossiz1 also revealed some degree of functional redundancy between OsSIZ2 and OsSIZ1.Therefore, Pi concentration in the xylem sap was assayed in\nthe culms of wild-types (NB and DJ) and the mutants (Ri1-3 and ossiz2) grown in a pot soil up to the grain-fillingstage (Fig. 5). Pi concentration in the xylem sap  was significantly higher in Ri1-3 (~21–83%) and ossiz2 (~35%)compared with their corresponding wild-type.. Although a similar trend of significantly elevated total P concentration was also observed in these tissues of ossiz1 and ossiz2 compared with DJ, the effect was more pronounced in ossiz1 than ossiz2.the relative expression analysis of Ri1-3 and ossiz2 provided evidence towards the differential regulatory influence of OsSIZ2 on a subset of molecular entities that governs Pi homeostasis in rice.The result provided some evidences towards the regulatory influence of OsSIZ1 on OsSIZ2 in roots of the seedlings grown under different Pi regime.",

Yield-related traits in Hwaseong, CR4379, and the transgenic lines were compared at maturity (Supplementary Table S4). The difference in DTH, PH, and SPP between all three OE lines and Hwaseong was significant (Fig. 2F). All OE lines had larger grains than Hwaseong, mainly due to increased GL and GW (Fig. 2E, F). The four T-DNA insertion lines showed variation in all traits measured. Insertion line #8 flowered earlier, and showed reduced PH and grain size compared with wild-type Dongjin, and line #5 was also shorter with fewer SPP and had smaller grains than Dongjin (Fig. 2F). Line #1 showed significant differences from Dongjin in PH, grain weight, and grain shape traits, and line #9 displayed a significant difference only for PH. We also evaluated MS5 T-DNA insertion mutants derived from the cultivar Hwayeong. No consistent differences in PH and DTH were observed between T-DNA insertion mutants and wild-type Hwayeong. However, the MS5 mutants all exhibited high spikelet sterility, which was consistent with a role of MS5 in grain fertility (Supplementary Table S5). These results indicate that APX9 is responsible for the QTL cluster that affects DTH, PH, SPP, GL, and GW.

Among them, 8 Ehd1-OX and 11 Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines at T1 generation were flowering earlier than wild type under NDs (two representative lines of each genotype were shown in Fig. 4, A and B), demonstrating that overexpression of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the later flowering phenotype of ABF1V.To measure and compare the flowering times between Ehd1OXand Ehd1-OX/ABF1V, two independent lines of each genotype expressing equal levels of Ehd1-Flag protein were selected for the investigation (Fig. 4C). The results showed that Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines were flowering about 4 d later than Ehd1-OX lines grown in NDs. This slight flowering difference might be due to the dosage effect of Ehd1 mRNA, because the transcription of endogenous Ehd1 was suppressed in Ehd1-OX/ABF1V but not in Ehd1-OX. Alternatively, ABF1V may not repress flowering in a manner entirely dependent on the Ehd1 pathway. Furthermore, we tested if ABF1E accelerates flowering through enhancing Ehd1 expression. In total, 18 and 15 Ehd1-RNAi transgenic lines in wild-type background (Ehd1R)and ABF1E-1 background (Ehd1RNAi/ABF1E) were generated, respectively. Among them, 15 Ehd1R and 12 Ehd1R/ABF1E lines at T1 generation were similarly flowering later than wild type under NDs (two representative lines of each genotype were shown in Supplemental Fig. S4), demonstrating that knockdown of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the early flowering phenotype of ABF1E. Taken together, our molecular and genetic results support the hypothesis that OsABF1 regulates flowering time through the Ehd1mediated flowering pathway.demonstrating that OsABF1-RNAi attenuates drought delay of flowering.

To elaborate the role of LHD1in the rice flowering pathway, we examined the expression levels of LHD1 and other heading date genes (OsGI, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, Hd1, Ehd1, Hd3a, RFT1) in both YIL79 and Teqing under long-day and short-day conditions, respectively. We found that no difference in the LHD1 expression levels could be detected between YIL79 and Teqing under both long-day and short-day conditions, respectively, suggesting that late flowering did not result from the LHD1 transcript. For OsGI, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, Hd1, no difference could be detected under long-day and short-day conditions between YIL79 and Teqing. The expression levels of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were less in YIL79 than those in Teqing under long-day conditions, but not under short-day conditions, indicating that LHD1 may suppress the expressions of these floral transition activators (Figure 4).",

Map-based cloning reveals that DTH8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor and the complementary experiment increased significantly days to heading, plant height, and number of grains per panicle in CSSL61 (a chromosome segment substitution line that carries the nonfunctional DTH8 allele) with the Asominori functional DTH8 allele under long-day conditions. DTH8 is expressed in most tissues and its protein is localized to the nucleus exclusively.

        "question": "To examine whether the expression of DTH8 is influenced by Hd1 and Ghd7, DTH8 expression was examined in Hd1 and Ghd7 near-isogenic lines (NILs) grown for 40 d under LD conditions. As shown in Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure S7A, the expression levels of DTH8 and Ghd7, compared with those in Nipponbare, were not changed in NIL (hd1) grown under LD conditions. However, Ehd1 and Hd3a were suppressed by Hd1 in Nipponbare. Similarly, no changes were found in the levels of DTH8 and Hd1 mRNA in the Ghd7 NILs under LD conditions. But the expressions of Ehd1 and Hd3a were also suppressed by Ghd7 (Fig. 6B; Supplemental Fig. S7B). These results indicate that DTH8 suppresses rice flowering by down-regulating the expression of Ehd1 and Hd3a, and that the expression of DTH8, Hd1,or Ghd7 is independent of each other under LD conditions.. Meanwhile, the differences between DTH8 and Ghd7 were also very obvious. Tiller number in Ghd7 NILs with functional or nonfunctional alleles differed from each other (Xue et al., 2008); those between Asominori and CSSL61 are the same (Fig. 1; Supplemental Tables S2 and S3). Ghd7 regulates the height through total cell number in the y axes of internodes and it also influences culm thickness, whereas DTH8 regulates height by altering cell elongation in the internodes, but keeps culm thickness stable (Fig. 7).",

        "question": "early flowering 8 (ef8) selected from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-treated population of indica cultivar 93-11. It showed earlier flowering, less grains per main panicle and slightly darker green leaves than the wildtype 93-11 under natural long-day conditions, but was not significantly different from 93-11 under natural short-day conditions. We isolated the Early Flowering 8 (EF8) gene by map-based cloning. EF8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor, which is localized to the nucleus.Using 452 recessive early-flowering individuals selected from this population, the EF8 gene was mapped to a 38 kb genomic region between markers Fm45 and Fm31 and co-segregated with Fm40 (Fig. 3A). This region contains six open reading frames (ORFs; http://www.gramene.org/; Fig. 2a). All of these genes were sequenced in the ef8 mutant and wild type, and by comparison we found that only the sixth ORF (Loc_Os08g07740) was changed, with a one base deletion at position 323 bp from the start codon in the ef8 mutant; this caused a frame-shift and premature termination of translation (Fig. 3b,c; Supplemental Fig. S2).

        "question": "Two independent floral regulators, Hd1 and Ehd1,control flowering through regulating Hd3a and RFT1 in rice (Izawa 2007; Tsuji et al. 2011). To investigate whether the alteration of expression patterns of the two ‘florigen’ genes by EF8 is mediated by Hd1, Ehd1 or other regulators of Hd1 and Ehd1, such as OsMADS51, OsMADS50 and OsGI (Hayama et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2010), we examined their mRNA levels between wild type and the ef8 mutant under LDs and SDs. Under LDs, to our surprise, no significant differences in the expression of any of these genes were detected between ef8 mutant and wild type (Fig. 5a). Under SDs, the expression pattern of Ehd1 was slightly changed in ef8 mutant compared to wild type, but the expression patterns of other genes were not changed (Fig. 5b). Together, these results indicated that EF8 delayed flowering through altering the rhythmic expression patterns of the ‘florigen’ genes Hd3a and RFT1 independently of Hd1 and Ehd1 under LDs.\nThe ef8 mutant displayed a slightly darker green leaf phenotype and more chlorophyll content compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. S1), which suggested that EF8 may have effect on chlorophyll biogenesis. To test this, we extracted total RNAs from 30-dayold leaves of wild-type and ef8 mutant seedlings under both LDs and SDs, and performed QRT-PCR to examine the expression of genes encoding the enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in rice. Most of these genes were up-regulated to different degrees except chlorophyll synthetase (CHLG)in ef8 mutant compared to wild type under LDs (Fig. 6a). For example, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM) and NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A (PORA) were up-regulated more than threefold, and Mg chelatase H subunit (CHLH) and divinyl reductase (DVR) about twofold. However, there were no significant differences in the transcription level of these genes under SDs (Fig. 6b). This result indicated that the higher chlorophyll content was due to higher expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes in the ef8 mutant compared to wild type and EF8 negatively regulated chlorophyll biogenesis under LDs.",

        "question": "We isolated a rice bglu6 mutant (04Z11IG62) with a T-DNA insertion in the sixth intron of the gene (Fig. 1a). Molecular analysis revealed that this T-DNA insertion resulted in no detectable expression ofBGLU6in leaves and roots (Fig. S1a,b). Phenotypic analysis showed that disruption of BGLU6 led to a 46.2% and 66.9% decrease in seedling plant height compared to the WT, at 7 and 14 d post-transplantation, respectively (Figs 1b, S1c,d). The dwarf phenotype was present throughout the entire growth and development stages (Figs 1b, S1c,d). By contrast, no difference was seen in root length of bglu6compared to the WT root length (data not shown). To confirm the role ofBGLU6on plant height, we generated bglu6 RE and OE transgenic rice lines by introducing an Ubiquitin-driven construct harboring BGLU6 (Fig. S2a). The plant height ofBGLU6RE lines were 93.2% that of the WT, indicating a nearly complete restoration of height through expression of BGLU6 in the mutant. BGLU6OE lines had a plant height of 120.5% of the WT (Fig. S2b,c). Likewise, no obvious difference was seen in root length and weight between these genotypes (data not shown). b-glucosidases have been reported to hydrolyze inactive ABAGE, and result in an increase in the endogenous ABA concentration. To investigate if the dwarfism is related to cellular ABA concentration, we examined the endogenous ABA content in leaves of the WT and the bglu6mutant at the seedling stage. ABA content in bglu6was 68.2% that of the WT (Fig. 1c). We also examined leafGA3 content and no difference was seen between the WT and the bglu6mutant (Fig. 1c), suggesting the enzyme is specific for hydrolysis of ABA-GE. Furthermore, spraying 10 lMABA onto bglu6leaves partly restored the plant height ofbglu6(Fig. 1d). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption of BGLU6 affects ABA concentration in leaves, resulting in a dwarfism in the mutant.\nUnder normal conditions, the hydrolysis activity ofABA-GE in the OE-5 line was 22.6% higher than that of the WT (Fig. 2c). After 2 d of drought stress, the hydrolysis activity in the WT and the OE-5 line was increased to 121% and 105% of activity before the treatment (Fig. 2c). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that BGLU6 hydrolyzes ABA-GE to ABA in vitro, and that this activity can be enhanced by drought stress.\nOf the downregulated DEGs, seven were related to stress. Of these, heat shock protein 81-2 (OS09G0482100), SPX domaincontaining protein (OS02G0202200) and embryonic abundant protein (OS05G0349800) were downregulated the most (Table S4). Four DEGs that participate in photosynthesis were identified, with ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain (OS01G0791033), ATP synthase subunit beta, chloroplastic (OS10G0355800) downregulated the most (Table S3). Besides these, we also found that positive regulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis process (GO0010116) was significantly enriched in the DEGs. The expression patterns of these DEGs were confirmed by q-RT-PCR analysis (Fig. S5). Taken together, the above results suggest that disruption of BGLU6 affects chloroplastic oxidative stress and lowers the photosynthesis efficiency, even under normal condition.\nBecause disruption of BGLU6 resulted in a decrease in endogenous ABA concentrations in leaves, and BGLU6 was localized to the chloroplast, we examined the stomatal characteristics of WT, bglu6, RE and OE lines in leaves. Under normal conditions, bglu6had significantly increased stomatal density, at 157.5% that of the WT. The increased stomatal density could be restored by expressing BGLU6 in the mutant, whereas in the OE line the density was not significantly different from that of the WT (Fig. 6a,c). After drought stress, stomatal density was slightly higher in these genotypes compared to that before treatment, except in the OE line, which had equivalent stomatal densities to those before stress (Fig. 6a,c). Taken together, these results indicate that disruption ofBGLU6affects stomatal density in leaves.",
        "answer": "A study isolated a rice bglu6 mutant with a T-DNA insertion that resulted in no detectable expression of BGLU6 in leaves and roots. This mutation led to a significant decrease in seedling plant height, but had no effect on root length. The researchers generated transgenic rice lines to confirm BGLU6's role in plant height, and found that reintroducing BGLU6 nearly restored the mutant's height. The study also found that the mutation affected the ABA concentration in leaves, resulting in dwarfism. Under drought stress, BGLU6 hydrolysis activity increased.

        "question": "Many of the GH3 genes in Arabidopsis, soybean, and tobacco were found to be differentially expressed in different tissues or in response to exogenous auxin and light stimuli (Tepperman et al. 2001; Hagen and Guilfoyle 2002; Tanaka et al. 2002; Takase et al. 2004). To determine the organ-specific expression pattern of each OsGH3 gene, real-time PCR was performed with total RNA isolated from etiolated shoots, green shoots, roots, flowers, and callus. This analysis revealed that OsGH3 genes are differentially expressed in various tissues/organs (Fig. 6a). The transcription of OsGH3-12 was found to be root-specific and was hardly detectable in other tissues examined (Fig. 6a). However, OsGH3-10 was found to be expressed at very low levels in all the tissues. In contrast, other OsGH3 genes were found to be expressed in almost all the tissues examined but at different levels.Also, significant differences were found in the transcript abundance ofOsGH3 genes in etiolated and green shoots (Fig. 6a)\n",

        "question": "knockout lines (KO-GL10) harbored a frameshift mutation that caused premature termination of translation (Fig. S4A and S4B). These KO-GL10 lines exhibited significantly decreased grain length, grain width, and 1000-grain weight compared to those of the HJX74 wild-type line (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E). In addition, heading date differed significantly between KO-GL10 and HJX74 (Fig. S4C), although we found no detectable differences in plant height, effective tiller numbers, or grain number (Fig. S4DeS4F). We also generated a genetic complementation construct for GL10 overexpression in the NIL-gl10 background via transformation with a p35S-GL10 vector (Fig. S5A and S5B). The GL10 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased grain length and grain weight compared to that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. 2B, 2F, 2G, 2H). Moreover, OE-GL10 grain phenotypes were distinct from that of KO-GL10 plants, with grain length and heading date positively correlating with GL10 expression level. Notably, the heading stage of OE-GL10 was earlier than that of NIL-gl10 (Fig. S5C). In addition, we found no significant differences between OE-GL10 and NIL-gl10 in grain width, plant height, effective tiller numbers, and grain number per plant (Fig. S5DeS5F). These results indicate that GL10 was a positive regulator of grain length, grain weight and heading date.\noverexpression of GL10 results in increased grain length and weight and earlier heading date. GL10 regulates grain length by promoting greater longitudinal cell growth in the grain glume. Additionally, GL10 participates in the regulation of gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathway genes in young panicle tissues. Analysis of GL10 haplotypes shows obvious divergence between the japonica and indica lineages.",

        "question": "Specifically, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides directly participate in nucleic acid synthesis, which provides the ultimate energy source for the synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, peptides and secondary metabolites [55]. The de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway (orotate pathway) is defined as the formation of uridine monophosphate (UMP)from carbamoyl phosphate (CP), orotate, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), and a few other phosphate metabolites [56]. Our metabolomics profiling result indicates that the major building blocks, which are pyrimidine bases such as thymine, cytosine and uracil, are reduced significantly upon heat stress, which affects overall pyrimidine biosynthesis and nucleic acid biosynthesis .",

        "question": "Energy metabolism is substantially higher in young leaves than that in mature leaves. Indeed, young leaves are actively growing and require a substantial and sustained amount of energy to support their metabolism. As a result, they tend to have higher rates of photosynthesis and respiration than mature leaves. (26,27) A previous study showed that monosaccharides are biosynthesized through photosynthesis in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) leaves at an early stage while sucrose biosynthesis takes place in mature leaves. (20) In agreement, we detected many monosaccharides (xylose, galactose, mannose, glucose, and fructose) that are biosynthesized through photosynthesis and respiration during the V stages of soybean leaf development. Also during the V stages, energy metabolism was active, leading to an accumulation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (fumaric and malic acid).",
        "answer": "Energy metabolism is higher in young leaves compared to mature leaves due to their active growth, requiring more energy for photosynthesis and respiration. Young leaves primarily biosynthesize monosaccharides, while mature leaves focus on sucrose biosynthesis.

        "question": "The cultivar Jiaoda 133 is a vegetable soybean, and Williams 82 is a grain soybean; there are several seed phenotypic differences between them. The Jiaoda 133 pods harvested at the R6 stage (stage 6)  and boiled in water for 7 min, tasted sweet, soft and fragrant, whereas those of Williams 82 were hard and neither sweet nor fragrant. For vegetable soybean, the sweet taste is a key trait. To check out which sugar contributed to the sweet taste, we measured the content of four sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose) in fresh seeds at the stage R6. The sucrose content was significantly higher in Jiaoda 133 (2.39 g/100 g) than Williams 82 (1.52 g/100 g). The contents of fructose and glucose were low, with no significant differences between Jiaoda 133 and Williams 82. No maltose was detected . These results suggested that the sweet taste was determined mainly by sucrose content. The pods and fresh grains of Jiaoda 133 were much larger than those of Williams 82 at various developmental stages . At maturity, the 100-grain weight of Jiaoda 133 was 31.38 g and that of Williams 82 was 17.87 g (that 1.75-fold difference was significant) .",

        "question": "In this study, GmMTP8.1, a member of group 8 within the Mn-CDF cluster , displayed highest similarity with ShMTP8 in S. hamata that has been well-characterized for its involvement in Mn detoxification by the sequestration of Mn into vacuoles, was further selected to dissect its function in Mn detoxification. The GmMTP8.1 protein includes 294 amino acid residues (33.1 kDa) and possesses common features of Mn-CDF transporters, such as four putative TMDs, cation efflux, and ZT dimer domains . The consensus sequence DxxxD (x = any amino acid) localizes to the first TMD and the cytosolic loop of GmMTP8.1 . In addition, based on amino acid sequence comparisons, GmMTP8.1 shares a high degree of homology identity (90.8%) with ShMTP8 in S. hamata, and shares 83.3% identity with HvMTP8.1 in barley, 83% identity with OsMTP8.1 in rice, 83% identity with CsMTP8 in cucumber, and 81% identity with AtMTP8 in Arabidopsis, which were the representative MTP8-like proteins included in group 8 . This suggests that the role of GmMTP8.1 is similar to that of the MTP homologs.",

        "question": "Soybean seed protein quality is largely determined by its protein composition. This is especially true in the case of β-subunit of β-conglycinin, a protein that is totally devoid of methionine, an essential amino acid [25]. Since rj1 accumulated very little β-subunit of β-conglycinin, the relative levels of essential amino acids were examined in the total seed protein of Rj1 and rj1 soybeans. Table 1 shows the amino acid composition of Rj1 and rj1 soybean. It is evident that rj1 soybeans, in spite of accumulating lower amounts of β-subunit of β-conglycinin, contained relatively lower amounts of methionine (Table 1). Interestingly, the relative amount of cysteine is higher in rj1 soybeans and its abundance was reduced in the presence of nitrogen, indicating nitrogen may influence the accumulation of proteins that are rich in cysteine",

        "question": "To test the interaction between native and variant Gα1 proteins and Gβ, the full-length proteins were expressed as prey (NUb fusions) and bait (CUb fusions), respectively, in the split-ubiquitin interaction system. In this assay, all native Gβ proteins (Gβ1–Gβ4) interacted with the native Gα1 and with the phospho-deficient Gα1 (Gα1quadA), but intriguingly no interaction was observed with Gα1quadD . To corroborate these interactions in planta, native Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD proteins were transiently co-expressed with Gβ and Gγ proteins in tobacco leaves. We used two soybean Gβ proteins (Gβ2 and Gβ3), which belong to two different subgroups, and three different Gγ proteins (Gγ1, Gγ5 and Gγ9), representing each of the Gγ subgroups (Roy Choudhury et al., 2011), to test the tripartite interaction of Gβγ with Gα1, Gα1quadA or Gα1quadD. In these assays, Gα1quadD also did not show any interaction, whereas the native Gα1 as well as Gα1quadA exhibited strong interactions with all tested combinations of Gβγ proteins . These data imply that the inability of the phosphorylated Gα proteins to interact with Gβγ, thereby making them constitutively available, is most likely to be the critical regulatory aspect of G-protein signaling during nodulation.",

In tobacco leaves, native Gα1 and Gα1quadA showed strong interactions with various Gβγ combinations, while Gα1quadD did not.

Gene Function Experimental Observation,"Under 200 mM NaCl stress, the KO1 and KO2 lines showed seed germination but almost no ________.",[],seedling growth,key_blank_fill,"Research Topic: Salt Tolerance in Seeds
Key Findings:
- The ability of seeds to germinate under high salinity conditions is an important indicator of salt tolerance.
- Germination experiments were performed using the seeds of WT plants, Osjrl45 mutant lines (KO1 and KO2), and OsJRL45-OE lines (OE1 and OE2) under control (0 mM NaCl) and salt treatments (100 and 200 mM NaCl).
- Under normal conditions, there was no difference in the seed germination rate and seedling growth among all genotypes.
- In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, the shoot and root lengths of knockout mutants seedlings were significantly reduced, while those of overexpression lines seedlings were significantly increased.
- Under 200 mM NaCl stress, the KO1 and KO2 lines showed seed germination but almost no seedling growth.
- The salt tolerance of WT and all knockout and overexpressed transgenic rice at the seedling period was analyzed. Under salt stress, the knockout plants indicated severe wilting, while the overexpressed plants grew better than WT plants.
- The chlorophyll content, fresh weights and dry weights of KO1 and KO2 plants were significantly lower after treatment than before treatment, while the chlorophyll contents of OE1 and OE2 plants were lower and their fresh weights and dry weights were significantly higher.
- The survival rates, chlorophyll contents, fresh weights, and dry weights of knockout plants seedlings were significantly lower than those of the WT plants, while those of overexpressed transgenic rice seedlings were higher under salinity stress treatments.
- These results suggest that OsJRL45 positively regulates salt tolerance at the germination and seedling stages.
- The OsJRL45 gene isolated from SR86 was transformed into the salt-sensitive indica cultivar L6-23. The promoter of OsJRL45 was cloned into the pCAMBIA1300 vector, and the resultant construct was transformed into L6-23 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to create transgenic rice (named Lh).
- The L6-23 plants suggested severe wilting, while the Lh plants grew better than the L6-23 rice under salt stress.
- RT-qPCR results indicated that the expression level of OsJRL45 was significantly higher in Lh transgenic rice than in L6-23 plants.
- Compared with the L6-23 plants, the survival rate and chlorophyll content of Lh",bad

Gene Product Cellular Localization Query,What happens to the TAC4 protein when 135 residues from the C terminus are lost?,[],"The loss of 135 residues from the C terminus of TAC4 resulted in the protein’s loss of function, yet it did not change the cellular localization.",key_text_generation,"Gene Name: TAC4
Protein: TAC4 protein is a novel protein predicted to be encoded by the TAC4 gene.
Localization: The TAC4 protein is localized in the nuclei of rice leaf protoplasts and in the roots of transgenic plants, suggesting it may function in the nucleus.
Modification: The loss of 135 residues from the C terminus of TAC4 resulted in the protein’s loss of function, yet it did not change the cellular localization.

Observation: Two homozygous positive transgenic plants were identified among gene-edited lines of the -T0 generation, and seedlings of these independent transgenic lines displayed an obvious white-striped leaf phenotype consistent with that of the osal50 mutant.
Specific Findings: 3-bp and 11-bp deletions were detected at the target site of LOC_Os01g20110 in the two transgenic lines, respectively. These deletions resulted in frameshift mutations.
Conclusion: LOC_Os01g20110 was identified as the candidate OsAL50 gene, with mutations in the associated promoter region potentially contributing to the observed albino phenotype in osal50 mutant plants.
Gene Expression: All of the genes were significantly down-regulated in osal50 mutant leaves compared with wild-type leaves at the four-leaf stage, with consistent expression patterns of transcriptional suppression in young panicles, including glumes and branches, of osal50 at the heading stage.
Further Findings: The expression levels of all of these genes were markedly increased in osal50 mutant leaves at the seven-leaf stage compared with those at the four-leaf stage, with certain genes' expression restored to wild-type levels and some even higher than those in the wild type at the seven-leaf stage.

Methods:
- Generation of T-DNA insertion knockout (ossiz2 in Dongjin [DJ] background) and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown (Ri1-3 in Nipponbare [NB] background) mutants.

- Southern blot analysis for confirming a single T-DNA insertion in ossiz2.
Findings:
- The relative expression levels of OsSIZ2 were significantly reduced (~35C58%) in Ri1-3 and undetected in ossiz2 compared with their corresponding wild-type.
- Ri1-3 and ossiz2 are confirmed as knockdown and knockout mutants, respectively, of OsSIZ2.
- OsSIZ2 plays a pivotal role in positive regulatory influences on the developmental responses of different morphometric traits during vegetative and reproductive growth phases.
- There is some degree of functional redundancy between OsSIZ2 and OsSIZ1.
- Pi concentration in the xylem sap was significantly higher in Ri1-3 (~21C83%) and ossiz2 (~35%) compared with their corresponding wild-type.
- The relative expression analysis of Ri1-3 and ossiz2 provided evidence towards the differential regulatory influence of OsSIZ2 on a subset of molecular entities that governs Pi homeostasis in rice.

Gene Function Experimental Observation,The research further tested if ________ accelerates flowering through enhancing Ehd1 expression.,[],ABF1E,key_blank_fill,"Research Objective: Test if ABF1V suppresses flowering through downregulation of Ehd1 expression.
Method: Generated 12 and 18 Pubi:Ehd1-Flag transgenic lines in wild-type background (Ehd1-OX)and ABF1V-1 background (Ehd1-OX/ ABF1V), respectively.
Findings: Overexpression of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the later flowering phenotype of ABF1V. Ehd1-OX/ABF1V lines were flowering about 4 days later than Ehd1-OX lines grown in NDs. 
Possible Explanation: This slight flowering difference might be due to the dosage effect of Ehd1 mRNA, because the transcription of endogenous Ehd1 was suppressed in Ehd1-OX/ABF1V but not in Ehd1-OX. Alternatively, ABF1V may not repress flowering in a manner entirely dependent on the Ehd1 pathway.
Further Test: Tested if ABF1E accelerates flowering through enhancing Ehd1 expression.
Method: Generated 18 and 15 Ehd1-RNAi transgenic lines in wild-type background (Ehd1R)and ABF1E-1 background (Ehd1RNAi/ABF1E), respectively.
Findings: Knockdown of Ehd1 can efficiently suppress the early flowering phenotype of ABF1E.

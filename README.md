# SeedBench: A Multi-task Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Seed Science

**SeedBench** is the first multi-task benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in seed science, focusing on seed breeding. This repository includes the dataset, evaluation code, and documentation to support research in this domain. [Here](https://github.com/open-sciencelab/SeedBench/issues/11) is the usage.

---

## üåæ Overview

SeedBench assesses LLMs across three core seed breeding stages:
- **Gene Information Retrieval**
- **Gene Function and Regulation Analysis**
- **Variety Breeding with Agronomic Trait Optimization**

*Breeding Expert Workflow Framework*

Built with domain experts, SeedBench features **2,264 expert-validated questions** across 11 task types and 10 subcategories, initially targeting rice breeding. Future updates will include other crops like maize, soybean, and wheat.

## üîé Dataset Details

- **Corpus**: 308,727 publications cleaned to 1.1 billion tokens; 279 segments from 113 documents.
- **Questions**: 2,264 across 11 task types, bilingual (English/Chinese), expert-validated.
- **Focus**: Rice breeding as a representative case.

  abstract = "Seed science is essential for modern agriculture, directly influencing crop yields and global food security. However, challenges such as interdisciplinary complexity and high costs with limited returns hinder progress, leading to a shortage of experts and insufficient technological support. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise across various fields, their application in seed science remains limited due to the scarcity of digital resources, complex gene-trait relationships, and the lack of standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench{---}the first multi-task benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific fine-tuned models. Our findings not only highlight the substantial gaps between the power of LLMs and the real-world seed science problems, but also make a foundational step for research on LLMs for seed design."
